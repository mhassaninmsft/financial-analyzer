ii	HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2021/2022 

##### <a id="_TOC_250001"></a>Foreword

We are living in uncertain times\. The Covid\-19 pandemic, now in its third year, continues to spin off new variants\. The war in Ukraine reverberates throughout the world, causing immense human suffering, including a cost\-of\-living crisis\. Climate and ecological disasters threaten the world daily\.

It is seductively easy to discount crises as one\-offs, natural to hope for a return to normal\. But dousing the latest fire or booting the latest demagogue will be an unwinnable game of whack\-a\-mole unless we come to grips with the fact that the world is fundamentally changing\. There is no going back\. Layers of uncertainty are stacking up and interacting to unsettle our lives in unprecedented ways\. People have faced diseases, wars and environmental disruptions before\. But the confluence of destabilizing planetary pressures with grow\- ing inequalities, sweeping societal transformations to ease those pressures and widespread polarization present new, complex, interacting sources of uncertainty for the world and

everyone in it\.

That is the new normal\. Understanding and responding to it are the goals of the 2021/2022 Human Development Re\- port, *Uncertain Times, Unsettled Lives: Shaping our Future in a Transforming World*\. It caps a trilogy of Reports beginning with the 2019 Report on inequalities, followed by the 2020 Report on the risks of the Anthropocene—where humans have become a major force driving dangerous planetary change\.

Thirty\-two years ago, the very first Human Development Report declared boldly that “people are the real wealth of nations\.” That powerful refrain has guided UNDP and its Hu\- man Development Reports ever since, with its messages and meanings taking on richer hues over time\.

People around the world are now telling us that they feel ever more insecure\. UNDP’s Special Report on Human Se\- curity, launched earlier this year, found that six out of seven people worldwide reported feeling insecure about many aspects of their lives, even before the Covid\-19 pandemic\.

Is it any wonder, then, that many nations are creaking under the strain of polarization, political extremism and demagoguery—all supercharged by social media, artificial intelligence and other powerful technologies?

Or that, in a stunning reversal from just a decade ago, democratic backsliding among countries has become the norm rather than the exception?

Or that, in a stunning first, the global Human Development Index value has declined for two years in a row in the wake of the Covid\-19 pandemic?

People are the real wealth of nations, mediated through our relationships with our governments, with our natural en\- vironments, with each other\. Each new crisis reminds us that when people’s capabilities, choices and hopes for the future feel dashed, the wellbeing of their nations and the planet are the accompanying casualties\.

Now let us imagine the reverse: what our nations, our planet, would look like if we expanded human development, including people’s agency and freedoms\. That would be a world where our creativity is unleashed to reimagine our fu\- tures, to renew and adapt our institutions, to craft new stories about who we are and what we value\. It would be not just a nice\-to\-have; it would be a must\-have when the world is in ongoing, unpredictable flux\.

We got a glimpse of what is possible in the Covid\-19 pan\- demic\. A battery of new vaccines, including some based on revolutionary technology, saved an estimated 20 million lives in one year\. Let that sink in, that extraordinary achievement in the annals of humankind\. Equally extraordinary is the num\- ber of unnecessary lives lost, especially in low\- and middle\- income countries, from highly unequal vaccine access\. The pandemic has been a painful reminder of how breakdowns in trust and in cooperation, among and within nations, foolishly constrain what we can achieve together\.

The hero and the villain in today’s uncertainty story are one in the same: human choice\. It is far too glib to encour\- age people to look for silver linings or to state that the glass is half full rather than half empty, for not all choices are the same\. Some—arguably the ones most relevant to the fate of our species—are propelled by institutional and cultural iner\- tia, generations in the making\.

This year’s Report invites us to take a hard look at ossi\- fied and oversimplified assumptions about human decision\- making\. Institutions assume away people’s messiness—our emotions, our biases, our sense of belonging—at our peril\.

As with its predecessors, the Report also challenges conventional notions of “progress,” where self\-defeating tradeoffs are being made\. Gains in some areas, as in years of schooling or life expectancy, do not compensate for losses in others, as in people’s sense of control over their lives\. Nor can we enjoy material wealth at the expense of planetary health\.

This Report firmly positions human development not just as a goal but as a means to a path forward in uncertain times, reminding us that people—in all our complexity, our diversity, our creativity—are the real wealth of nations\.

##### <a id="_TOC_250000"></a>Acknowledgements

We live in a world of worry: the ongoing Covid\-19 pandemic, continuing regional and local conflicts, record\-breaking temperatures, fires and storms\. Many reports document these challenges and initiatives and offer recommendations on how to address them, but this year’s Hu\- man Development Report is an invitation to take a step back\. Many challenges, rather than being separate, may be trou\- bling manifestation of an emerging, new uncertainty complex that is unsettling lives around the world\. The 2019 Human Development Report explored inequali\- ties in human development, the 2020 Human Development Report focused on how those inequalities drive and are exacerbated by the dangerous planetary change of the Anthropocene, and the 2022 Special Report on Human Security examined the emergence of new forms of insecurity\. The 2021/2022 Human Development Report unites and extends these discussions under the theme of uncertainty—how it is changing, what it means for human development and how we can thrive in the face of it\. The linger\- ing effects of the pandemic made pre\- paring the Report challenging, including through delays in key data availability\. The Report was made possible because of the encouragement, generosity and contributions of so many, recognized only imperfectly and partially in these acknowledgments\.

The members of our Advisory Board, led by Michèle Lamont and Tharman Shanmugaratnam as co\-chairs, sup\- ported us in multiple and long virtual meetings, providing extensive advice on four versions of lengthy drafts\. The other members of the Advisory Board were Olu Ajakaiye, Kaushik Basu, Diane Coyle, Oeindrila Dube, Cai Fang, Marc Fleur\- baey, Amadou Hott, Ravi Kanbur, Ha\- rini Nagendra, Thomas Piketty, Belinda

Reyers, Dan Smith, Qixiang Sun, Ilona Szabó de Carvalho, Krushil Watene and Helga Weisz\.

Complementing the advice from our Advisory Board, the Report’s Statistical Advisory Panel provided guidance on several methodological and data aspects of the Report—in particular those related to calculating the Report’s human devel\- opment indices\. We are grateful to all the panel members: Mario Biggeri, Camilo Ceita, Ludgarde Coppens, Koen Decan\- cq, Marie Haldorson, Jason Hickel, Steve Macfeely, Mohd Uzir Mahidin, Silvia Montoya, Shantanu Mukherjee, Michaela Saisana, Hany Torky and Dany Wazen\.

We are thankful for especially close collaborations with our partners: the CUNY Advanced Science Research Cen\- ter, including Anthony D\. Cak, Pamela Green and Charles Vörösmarty; the part\- nership between the German Institute of Development and Sustainability & V\- Dem Institute, University of Gothenburg, including Francesco Burchi, Charlotte Fiedler, Jean Lachapelle, Julia Leininger, Staffan I\. Lindberg, Svend\-Erik Skan\- ning and Armin Von Schiller; the Global Policy Laboratory at the University of California, Berkeley, including Solomon Hsiang, Jonathan Proctor, Luke Sher\- man and Jeanette Tseng; the Institute for Economics and Peace, including Andrew Etchell, David Hammond, Steven Killelea and Paulo Pinto; the Peace Research Institute Oslo, including Siri Aas Rustad, Andrew Arasmith and Gudrun Østby; the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, including Richard Black, Claire McAllister and Jürg Staudenmann; the Stockholm Resilience Centre, including David Collste, Beatrice Crona, Victor Galaz and Louise Hård af Segerstad; and the World Inequality Lab, including Lucas Chancel, Amory Gethin and Clara Martinez\-Toledano\.

Appreciation is also extended for all the data, written inputs and peer reviews of draft chapters to the Report, includ\- ing those by Saleem H\.

We are grateful for the highly profes\- sional work of our editors and layout artists at Communications Development Incorporated—led by Bruce Ross\-Larson with Joe Caponio, Meta de Coquereau\- mont, Mike Crumplar, Christopher Trott and Elaine Wilson\. Bruce, in particular, has been a constant source of sound advice, inspiration and, not infrequently, motivation\.

As always, we are extremely grateful to UNDP Administrator Achim Steiner\. Facing the demands of leading an orga\- nization during unprecedented times, he always found time to give probing advice and to provide encouragement\. He has consistently given the team the freedom to explore and to venture beyond well\- trodden paths\. At a time when expanding freedoms is essential to navigate uncer\- tainties, we hope to have made good use of that incredible trust and commitment to the editorial independence of every Human Development Report\.

##### Uncertain times, unsettled lives

2	HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2021/2022 

<a id="_bookmark1"></a>We live in a world of worry\. The ongoing Covid\-19 pandemic, which has driven reversals in human de\- velopment in almost every country and continues to spin off variants unpredictably\. War in Ukraine and elsewhere, more human suffering amid a shifting geopolitical order and strained multilateral system\. Record\-breaking temperatures, fires and storms, each an alarm bell from planetary systems increasingly out of whack\. Acute crises are giving way to chronic, lay\- ered, interacting uncertainties at a global scale, paint\- ing a picture of uncertain times and unsettled lives\.

Uncertainty is not new\. Humans have long worried about plagues and pestilence, violence and war, floods and droughts\. Some societies have been brought to their knees by them\. At least as many have embraced emerging, unsettling realities and found clever ways to thrive\. There are no inevitabilities, just tough un\- knowns whose best answer is a doubling down on human development to unleash the creative and co\- operative capacities that are so essentially human\.

Novel layers of uncertainties are interacting to create new kinds of uncertainty—a new uncertainty complex

—never seen in human history \(figure 1\)\. In addition to the everyday uncertainty that people have faced since

time immemorial, we are now navigating uncharted waters, caught in three volatile crosscurrents:

- The dangerous planetary change of the Anthropocene\.1
- The pursuit of sweeping societal transformations on par with the Industrial Revolution\.
- The vagaries and vacillations of polarized societies\. Navigating this new uncertainty complex is ham\- pered by persistent deprivations and inequalities in human development\. The past decade finally placed inequality under a spotlight, but less illuminated were the ways that inequalities and uncertainty con\- tribute to insecurity and vice versa\. The variation in opportunity and outcome among and within nations is mirrored by—and interacts with—the volatility that people experience in their lives\. Complicating matters is a geopolitical order in flux, hamstring\- ing a multilateral system designed for postwar, not postmillennium, challenges and creaking under the

weight of naked national interests\.

The Covid\-19 pandemic and the war in Ukraine are devastating manifestations of today’s uncer\- tainty complex\. Each exposes limits of—and cracks in— current global governance\. Each has battered

<a id="_bookmark2"></a>global supply chains, driving up price volatility in en\- ergy, food, fertilizers, commodities and other goods\. But it is their interaction that, at the time of this writ\- ing, is transforming shocks into an impending global catastrophe\. UN Secretary\-General António Guterres has repeatedly warned of a prolonged global food cri\- sis due to the confluence of war, pandemic and warm\- ing temperatures\.2 Billions of people face the greatest cost\-of\-living crisis in a generation\.3 Billions already grapple with food insecurity,4 owing largely to inequal\- ities in wealth and power that determine entitlements to food\. A global food crisis will hit them hardest\.

Global crises have piled up: the global financial crisis, the ongoing global climate crisis and Covid\- 19 pandemic, a looming global food crisis\. There is a nagging sense that whatever control we have over our lives is slipping away, that the norms and institutions we used to rely on for stability and prosperity are not up to the task of today’s uncertainty complex\. Feel\- ings of insecurity are on the rise nearly everywhere, a trend that is at least a decade in the making and that well precedes the Covid\-19 pandemic and the atten\- dant tailspin in global human development \(figure 2\)\.

Even before the Covid\-19 pandemic, more than 6 in 7 people at the global level felt insecure\.5 This against a backdrop of incredible global progress \(not\- withstanding the impacts of the Covid\-19 pandemic\) over the longer run on conventional measures of well\- being, including on many of the human development metrics tracked by the Human Development Report\. What is going on? How does the wide\-angle lens of human development help us understand and respond to this apparent paradox of progress with insecurity? Such questions animate this year’s Report \(box 1\)\.

One of the frustrating ironies of the Anthropocene is that while we have more power to influence our future, we do not necessarily have any more control over it\. From the climate crisis to far\-reaching tech\- nological changes, other important forces—many of our own making—are expanding the set of possible outcomes, some unknowable, of any given action\. For many, getting from point A to point B in their lives and in their communities feels unclear, unsure, hard

—harder still when persistent inequalities, polariza\- tion and demagoguery make it difficult to agree on what point B even is and to get moving\.

<a id="_bookmark3"></a>__Box 1 The 2021/2022 Human Development Report extends the conversations of earlier Reports__

How to understand and navigate today’s uncertainty complex—driven by the Anthropocene, by purposeful so\- cietal transformation and by intensifying polarization—is the topic of this year’s Human Development Report\. Much attention over the past decade has been rightly paid to in\- equalities\. Indeed, inequalities and their emerging dimen\- sions were the focus of the 2019 Human Development Report,1 carried forward into the following year’s Report on the socioecological pressures of the Anthropocene\.2 The variations in opportunity and outcome among and within nations also happen within people’s lives, giving rise to more and new forms of insecurity, which were ex\- plored in the United Nations Development Programme’s Special Report on Human Security earlier this year\.3 The 2021/2022 Human Development Report unites and ex\- tends these discussions under the theme of uncertainty— how it is changing, what it means for human development and how we can thrive in the face of it\.

All is not well, but all is not lost, either\. Policies that focus on the Three I’s—investment, insurance and innovation—will go a long way in helping people nav\- igate the new uncertainty complex and thrive in the face of it \(see chapter 6\)\.

- 
	- *Investment, *ranging from renewable energy to preparedness for pandemics and extreme natural hazards, will ease planetary pressures and pre\- pare societies to better cope with global shocks\. Consider the advances in seismology, tsunami sciences and disaster risk reduction following the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami\.6 Smart, practical in\- vestments pay off\.
	- *Insurance *does too\. It helps protect everyone from the contingencies of an uncertain world\. The global surge in social protection in the wake of the Covid\-19 pandemic did just that, while under\- scoring how little social insurance coverage there was before and how much more remains to be done\. Investments in universal basic services such as health and education also afford an insurance function\.
	- *Innovation *in its many forms—technological, economic, cultural—will be vital in responding to

unknown and unknowable challenges that human\- ity will face\. While innovation is a whole\-of\-society affair, government is crucial in this regard: not just in creating the right policy incentives for inclusive innovation but also in being an active partner throughout\.

Deeper still are the assumptions underpinning in\- stitutions that develop and implement policy at all levels\. Assumptions about how people make deci\- sions are often oversimplified\. The dominance of these assumptions has occasioned a narrower set of policy options than what is needed to navigate the new uncertainty complex \(see chapter 3\)\. Widen\- ing the set of policy options starts with recognizing the many cognitive biases and inconsistencies we all have in our decisionmaking\. Moreover, what we de\- cide is often rooted in what we value\. What we value is in turn rooted in our social context\. It is contextual, malleable\. Scrutinizing unhelpful social inertias and experimenting with new narratives must be part of the toolbox going forward \(see chapter 3\)\.

So must technology\. True, technology is more dou\- ble\-edged sword than silver bullet\. Fossil\-fuel com\- bustion technologies are warming the planet while nuclear fusion promises to bottle the sun, ushering in a new era of limitless, clean energy\. With every in\- ternet search, retweet and like, our digital footprints generate more data than ever, but we struggle to use it for the common good, and some deliberately mis\- use it\. In a voracious scramble for more of our data, technology giants are concentrating in their hands more and more power over everyone’s lives\. The trick for us is to bend technology purposefully towards in\- clusive, creative solutions to challenges old and new rather than allowing it to function like a bull in a china shop, breaking things just because\. We need technol\- ogies that augment labour rather than displace it, that disrupt selectively rather than indiscriminately \(see chapter 4\)\.

As we drift further into this new uncertainty com\- plex, unknown challenges loom—more tough ques\- tions without easy answers, more self\-defeating opportunities to retreat within borders that are as po\- rous to climate and technology as they have been to Covid\-19\. If the pandemic is seen as a test run of how we navigate our shared, global future, then we need to learn from it, from the good and the bad, to figure out how to do better\. Much better\.

<a id="_bookmark4"></a>The Covid\-19 pandemic is a window into a new reality

Now in its third year, the Covid\-19 pandemic has ex\- acted a terrible toll in lives and livelihoods around the world\. It is more than a long detour from normal; it is a window into a new reality, a painful glimpse into deep, emblematic contradictions, exposing a conflu\- ence of fragilities\.

On the one hand, an impressive feat of modern science: the development of safe, effective vaccines to a novel virus in less than a year\. Having saved tens, perhaps hundreds, of millions of lives over the past century, especially of children, vaccines re\- main one of humanity’s greatest, most cost\-effective

technological innovations— ever\.7 The battery of Covid\-19 vaccines is no exception\. In 2021 alone Covid\-19 vaccination programmes averted nearly 20 million deaths\.8 It is a lesson of the power of tech\- nology to transform lives for the better at a time when we hear so much about the ways technology can do just the opposite\.

But access to Covid\-19 vaccines remains appalling\- ly low or virtually nonexistent in many low\-income countries \(figure 3\), especially in Africa, which have endured age\-specific infection fatality rates twice those of high\-income countries\.9 Reaching rural areas with weaker cold chains and fewer healthcare workers remains difficult\. Meanwhile, vaccine uptake in many richer countries has stalled, due partly to

<a id="_bookmark5"></a>perplexing disputes about vaccines generally\.10 The last mile is long in every country\.

Unequal, unjust access to Covid\-19 vaccines is one of many inequalities that have weighed heavily throughout the pandemic\. Indeed, those inequalities have helped fuel its spread\. The groups most likely to be left behind have borne the brunt of its health and economic risks\. Women and girls have shouldered even more household and caregiving responsibili\- ties, while violence against them has worsened \(see chapter 2\)\.11 Pre\-existing digital divides have wid\- ened gaps in children’s education access and quality\.12 Some fear a “lost generation” of learners\.13

For people everywhere the Covid\-19 pandemic has generated questions without easy answers, fore\- most among them: When is this “over”? Answers have proved fleeting, often dashed by upticks in cases or the setting of new restrictions, forcing us back to square one\. Global supply chains remain stubborn\- ly knotted, contributing to inflation in all countries

—and in some, at rates not seen in decades\.14 The implications of unprecedented monetary and fiscal interventions aiming to rescue ravaged economies, many still scarred by the global financial crisis, re\- main largely uncertain\. They unspool before us in real time and alongside resurgent geopolitical ten\- sions\. The pandemic is more than a virus, and it sim\- ply is not “over\.”

With successive waves that have caught countries flat\-footed time and time again, ongoing mutability and the seesawing of lockdowns, the Covid\-19 pan\- demic and its seemingly endless twists and turns have—perhaps above all else—entrenched a climate of dogged uncertainty and unsettledness\. And this is just one pandemic, having emerged seemingly out of nowhere, like a phantom that cannot be exorcised\. We were long warned about the threat of novel res\- piratory pathogens\.15 As we move deeper into the An\- thropocene, we have been warned that there will be more\.

A new uncertainty complex is emerging

The impacts of the Covid\-19 pandemic on economies pale beside the upheavals expected by powerful new technologies and the hazards and transformations they pose\. What do investments in people’s education and skills—a key part of human development—look

like in the face of the disorienting pace of techno\- logical change, including automation and artificial intelligence? Or in the face of deliberate, necessary energy transitions that would restructure societies? More broadly, amid unprecedented patterns of dan\- gerous planetary change, what capabilities matter and how?

The impacts of the Covid\-19 pandemic on economies pale beside the upheavals expected by powerful new technologies and the hazards and transformations they pose

“

Recent years have seen more record temperatures, fires and storms around the world, alarming remind\- ers that the climate crisis marches on, alongside other planetary\-level changes wrought by the Anthropo\- cene\. Biodiversity collapse is one of them\. More than 1 million plant and animal species face extinc\- tion\.16 As much as the Covid\-19 pandemic caught us by surprise, unprepared and fumbling for paths for\- ward, we have even less of an idea of how to live in a world without, say, an abundance of insects\. That has not been tried for about 500 million years, when the world’s first land plants appeared\. This is not a coin\- cidence\. Without an abundance of insect pollinators, we face the mindboggling challenge of growing food and other agricultural products at scale\.

Human societies and ecological systems have long influenced—and surprised— one another, but not at the scales and speeds of the Anthropocene\. Hu\- mans are now shaping planetary trajectories,17 and the dramatically changing baselines—from global temperatures to species diversity—are altering the fundamental frame of reference humans have been operating under for millennia\. It is as if the ground beneath our feet is shifting, introducing a new kind of planetary uncertainty for which we have no real guide\. Material cycles, for example, have been upended\. For the first time in history, humanmade materials, such as concrete and asphalt, outweigh the Earth’s biomass\. Microplastics are now everywhere: in coun\- try\-sized garbage patches in the ocean, in protect\- ed forests and distant mountaintops and in people’s lungs and blood\.18 Mass coral bleaching is now com\-

monplace rather than extraordinary\.19

The latest International Panel on Climate Change Report is a “code red for humanity\.”20 While we still

<a id="_bookmark6"></a>have the possibility to prevent excessive global warm\- ing and avoid the worst scenarios, human\-induced changes to our planetary system are expected to con\- tinue well into the future\. In essence, as science has advanced, the models are, with better precision than before, predicting more volatility\.21

Any one of the rapid, planetary\-level, human\-in\- duced changes of the Anthropocene would be enough on its own to inject frightening new uncertainties into the fate of not just individuals, communities or even nations, but of all humankind\. Recall just a few dec\- ades ago when chlorofluorocarbons entered global consciousness\. Or the insecticide known as DDT be\- fore that\. Or nuclear proliferation before that \(and, sadly, still today\)\. The human\-induced forces at work in the Anthropocene are not atomized or neatly se\- quenced\. They are not islands of perturbations in a sea of relative stability\. Instead, they are stacked on top of each other, interacting and amplifying in un\- predictable ways\. For the first time in human history, anthropogenic existential threats loom larger than those from natural hazards\.22

The layering and interactions of multidimensional risks and the overlapping of threats give rise to new dimensions of

“

uncertainty, if for no other reason than human choices have impacts well beyond our weakened socioecological systems’ capacities to absorb them

For this reason, in its portraiture of uncertainty, the Report does not build scenarios\. Instead, it explores how three novel sources of uncertainty at the global level stack up to create a new uncertainty complex that is unsettling lives and dragging on human devel\- opment \(see chapter 1\):

- The first novel uncertainty is associated with the Anthropocene’s dangerous planetary change and its interaction with human inequalities\.
- The second is the purposeful if uncertain transition towards new ways of organizing industrial societies

—purporting transformations similar to those in the transition from agricultural to industrial societies\.23

- The third is the intensification of political and so\- cial polarization across and within countries—and of misperceptions both about information and across groups of people—facilitated by how new digital technologies are often being used\.24

The layering and interactions of multidimensional risks and the overlapping of threats give rise to new dimensions of uncertainty, if for no other reason than human choices have impacts well beyond our weak\- ened socioecological systems’ capacities to absorb them\. In this new uncertainty complex shocks can amplify and interact rather than dissipate; they can be propagated in systems rather than stabilized by them\.

Human pulsing of natural systems at unprecedent\- ed intensities and scales is one side of the uncertainty coin\. On the other are stubborn social deficits, in\- cluding deficits in human development, which make it more difficult to navigate unpredictable outcomes and to dial down those pulses in the first place\. Con\- sider the Covid\-19 pandemic, which has as much to do with inequalities, poor leadership and distrust as it does with variants and vaccines\. Or competition for environmental resources, competition that does not typically break down into conflict\. While stressed ecosystems can parallel grievances, grievances be\- come conflicts due to social imbalances\.25 Political power, inequalities and marginalization contribute more to environmental conflict than does access to natural resources\.

Political polarization complicates matters further \(figure 4\)\. It has been on the rise, and uncertainty makes it worse and is worsened by it \(see chapter 4\)\. Large numbers of people feel frustrated by and alien\- ated from their political systems\.26 In a reversal from just 10 years ago, democratic backsliding is now the prevailing trend across countries\.27 This despite high support globally for democracy\. Armed conflicts are also up, including outside so\-called fragile contexts\.28 For the first time ever, more than 100 million people are forcibly displaced, most of them within their own countries\.29

The conjunction of uncertainty and polarization may be paralyzing— delaying action to curb human pressures on the planet\. The real paradox of our time may be our inability to act, despite mounting evi\- dence of the distress that human planetary pressures are causing ecological and social systems\. Unless we get a handle on the worrying state of human affairs, we face the Anthropocene’s vicissitudes with one hand tied behind our backs\.

Even when functioning properly, conventional crisis response and risk management mechanisms,

New strategies are needed for tail events synchronized at the global level\. Addressing risk through diversification is difficult when volatili\- ty affects the entire system rather than only parts of it\.

Earlier this year, the United Nations Development Programme’s Special Report on Human Security found similarly troubling levels of perceived insecu\- rity\. Even before the Covid\-19 pandemic, more than 6 in 7 people at the global level felt insecure\.34 Per\- ceived human insecurity is high across all Human De\- velopment Index \(HDI\) groups, and it has increased, even in some very high HDI countries \(figure 6\)\. Po\- larization has moved in tandem in recent years\. In parallel, there is a breakdown of trust: globally, fewer than 30 percent of people think that most people can be trusted, the lowest value on record \(see chapter 4\)\. These and other data paint a puzzling picture in which people’s perceptions about their lives and their societies stand in stark contrast to historically high measures of aggregate wellbeing, including long\- standing multidimensional measures of wellbeing, such as the HDI and other indices that accompany this Report\. In sum, twin paradoxes: progress with in\-

security and progress with polarization\. What is going on?

Too often the answer is reduced to fault\-finding in\- quiries about whether the data or the people are wrong\. Most likely, neither\. Although people tend to express a holistic view of their lived experience, the questions

asked about their lives often focus on specific, measur\- able subsets of that experience: years of schooling, life expectancy, income\. However important these metrics are—and they are—they do not capture the totality of a lived experience\. Nor were they ever intended to re\- flect the full concept of human development, which goes well beyond achievements in wellbeing, such as reducing poverty or hunger, to include equally impor\- tant notions of freedoms and agency, which together expand the sense of possibility in people’s lives\. Nor do individual achievements necessarily capture social co\- hesion and trust, which matter to people in their own right and for working together towards shared goals\. In short, the twin paradoxes invite a hard look at narrow conceptions of “progress\.”

The 2019 Human Development Report empha\- sized going beyond averages to understand the wide and growing variation in capabilities within many countries\. It identified widening gaps in enhanced capabilities, such as access to higher education and life expectancy at age 70, gaps that might also help explain the apparent disconnect between what peo\- ple say about their lives and what we measure about them\. These are not either\-or explanations; all are possible, even probable\.35

Capabilities face more volatile futures while becom\- ing ever more important for helping people navigate the systemic uncertainties of a new epoch\. Achieving gains may become harder, securing them harder still\. Backsliding may become more sudden or common or both; it has already become evident during the Covid\- 19 pandemic\. For the first time on record, the glob\- al HDI value declined, taking the world back to the time just after the adoption of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Paris Agreement\. Every year a few different countries experience dips in their respective HDI values\. But a whopping 90 per\- cent of countries saw their HDI value drop in either 2020 or 2021 \(figure 7\), far exceeding the number that experienced reversals in the wake of the global finan\-

Choices mediate the translation of one’s values and commitments into achievements, but the idea of choice becomes ever more abstract, no matter how for\- mally educated or healthy we may be, if we doubt that the choices we make will yield the outcomes we desire\. Losing perceived control rather than simply not having it in the first place has its own negative consequences, as do the knock\-on effects: a tendency to identify cul\- prits or villains, a distrust of institutions and elites, and greater insularity, nationalism and social discord\.

by algorithms and, in particular, by artificial intel\- ligence\. For people who are online, every aspect of their lives becomes commodifiable data, raising wor\- rying questions about who has access to what infor\- mation, especially sensitive personal information, and how it is being used\.36

The political, commercial and personal all get mixed together in social media, which is full of loud echo chambers because they draw eyeballs, which draws

advertising and other revenues\. At least half the on\- line noise is from bots designed to stir the pot\.37 Mis\- information moves faster and farther than information that has been subjected to reasoned scrutiny, sowing distrust and fanning perhaps the gravest kind of un\- certainty: not knowing how to distinguish between the two\. Making the distinction goes beyond clear\-cut objectivism or the reliance on an agreed set of univer\- sal facts, scientific or otherwise\. Motivated reasoning,

<a id="_bookmark10"></a>in which people select facts, experts and other trusted sources of information that confirm their already\-held beliefs, is widespread across political spectra and ed\- ucation levels \(see chapter 3\)\. Polarization can take dangerous forms when different groups operate with entirely different sets of facts and, thus, realities, es\- pecially when those realities are bound up with group identities\. Technologies then turn mere disagreements into pitched battles for survival \(see chapter 4\)\.

Given the ways technology use can aggravate at the societal level, its harmful effects at the commu\- nity and individual levels may come as no surprise\. As it is in so many parts of our lives, technology is a double\-edged sword\. Artificial intelligence will both create and destroy tasks, causing tremendous disrup\- tion\. Synthetic biology opens new frontiers in health and medicine while raising fundamental questions about what it means to be human\. From the invention of writing to Gutenberg’s printing press to Marco\- ni’s first radio transmissions, technologies have been connecting people ever faster in new ways, now in\- stantaneously and across great distances\. Today, tele\- medicine is especially valuable in digitally connected rural areas and has been vital for mental and physical health during the pandemic\.38

At the same time, rather paradoxically, technology can isolate\. Internet use has been found to reduce of\- fline interaction, political participation and various forms of civic and cultural engagement\.39 The con\- sequences of substituting the digital for the real are complex and will be made more so as virtual worlds

—the metaverse—take up more real estate\. Cyberbul\- lying is an issue on social media, and angry Twitter mobs, mobilized sometimes by disinformation, can digitally tar and feather someone faster than in real life\. Sometimes that spills over into real\-life violence or into real\-life policy\. Digital addiction is a real con\- cern\. Random rewards in the form of likes on Insta\- gram or TikTok or the adrenaline rush of clickbait are essentially cognitive hacks that lie at the heart of most real\-life casinos \(see chapter 2\)\.40

Mental wellbeing is under assault

Mental wellbeing is an important, complex issue globally without any single driver, technological or otherwise\. Mental distress, whose prevention is a

critical aspect of overall mental wellbeing, is aggra\- vated by uncertainties and insecurities of all stripes: by major Anthropocene phenomena, such as climate change; by age\-old scourges of discrimination, exclu\- sion, conflict and violence; and by relatively newer entrants, such as social media and other technologies\. The uncertainties of the Anthropocene are expect\- ed to undermine people’s mental wellbeing through four main pathways: traumatizing events, physical illness, general climate anxiety and food insecurity \(see chapter 2\)\. The effects these and other pathways have on children in particular are profound, altering brain and body development, especially in families on lower social rungs, potentially diminishing what children can achieve in life\. The 2019 Human Devel\- opment Report explored how inequalities in human development are perpetuated across generations;41 it is not difficult to see how the confluence of mental distress, inequality and insecurity foment a similarly injurious intergenerational cycle that drags on human

development\.

The uncertainties of the Anthropocene are expected to undermine people’s mental wellbeing through four main pathways: traumatizing events, physical illness, general climate anxiety and food insecurity

“

Violence— even the threat of violence, its uncertainty—is a major driver of mental distress\. Some survivors of and witnesses to violence suffer trauma, which if not addressed properly can devel\- op into post\-traumatic stress disorder, among other chronic health conditions, that can weigh heavily on the choices available to them\. Violence may be di\- rected at one person or group of people, but it affects everybody in its blast radius\. Even perpetrators of violence can suffer trauma due to the violent setting that often surrounds them, as with organized crime or gang violence\.42

The losses exacted by violence extend well beyond direct physical, mental and emotional injury or trau\- ma\. Violence can cause and exacerbate all kinds of insecurities—food, economic and so forth—that are themselves major drivers of mental distress\. Many kinds of violence, from interpersonal violence to or\- ganized crime to armed conflict, perniciously under\- mine trust in people we know and in people we do not

<a id="_bookmark11"></a>know\. Breakdowns in trust may then beget more in\- stability, more violence\.

Mental disorders weigh on human development in many ways\. A health issue themselves, they are often linked to other health challenges\. They can impede school attendance and learning, as well as the ability to find a job and be fully productive at it\. The stigma that often accompanies

mental disorders makes matters worse

Then there is the loss of agency due to violence\. The complex interplay of forces, rooted in asymmetries of power, is powerfully at work in intimate partner vi\- olence, whose survivors are predominately women and which is correlated with some measures of wom\- en’s economic dependence \(see chapter 2\)\. Channels of dominance at the societal and institutional levels can take concentrated, wicked forms—especially for women, children and older people—behind what are meant to be the safe walls of a home, leaving those subjected to domestic abuse with either the percep\- tion or the reality of no escape\. The ensuing entrap\- ment of people violates human rights, constrains agency and ultimately undercuts our collective ability

Mental disorders, such as post\-traumatic stress disorder and depression, can develop when men\- tal distress is severe and untreated\. Almost 1 billion people—roughly one in eight of us—live with a men\- tal disorder,48 providing a lower\-bound estimate of the broader problem of mental distress\. Globally, mental health issues are the leading cause of disabil\- ity\. Yet, of those who need mental health attention or treatment, only about 10 percent receive it\.49 On average, countries spend less than 2 percent of their healthcare budgets on mental health\.50

Mental disorders weigh on human development in many ways\. A health issue themselves, they are often linked to other health challenges\. They can impede school attendance and learning, as well as the abili\- ty to find a job and be fully productive at it\. The stig\- ma that often accompanies mental disorders makes matters worse\. Mental disorders are uniquely chal\- lenging because the primary instrument to navigate life’s challenges—the mind—is precisely the thing that people living with a mental disorder may not be able to rely on\. The other thing we tend to rely on is relationships\. If those also suffer, people are left even more isolated and vulnerable\.

to navigate a turbulent new era\.		

As it has been in so many ways, the Covid\-19 pan\- demic is ominously illustrative\. During the first year of the pandemic, the global prevalence of depres\- sion and anxiety increased by more than 25 percent\.43 Low\-income people, especially those who struggle to afford basic needs such as rent and food, suffered disproportionally in several countries\.44 Women, who assumed most of the additional domestic and care work that emerged during school closures and lock\- downs,45 faced much higher mental distress than be\- fore the crisis\.46

Stressors need not reach the level of globalized trauma to cause mental distress\. In fact, one of the most serious economic threats to mental wellbeing seems to stem from repeated financial shocks, such as income loss, especially for poor people and for men\.47 Economic insecurity— or just the perception of such insecurity, even if transitory—is a major fac\- tor\. Mental distress is one reason why economic dis\- locations, whether from globalization or automation or phasing out fossil fuels, carry some large, underap\- preciated risks\.

Purposeful transformations introduce their own uncertainties

Today’s new uncertainty complex is not just about the planetary pressures of the Anthropocene and politi\- cal and social polarization; it is also about purposeful societal transformations that seek to ease planetary pressures and leverage the positive potential of new technologies \(see chapter 1\)\. From energy systems to food production to transportation, easing planetary pressures demands fundamental changes to much of the way the world currently operates\. It is a nec\- essary, wildly worthwhile investment—ethically, en\- vironmentally, economically—but it comes with its own significant uncertainties, especially for econo\- mies, livelihoods and pocketbooks\.51

The energy transitions required to confront the cli\- mate crisis would be challenging even in the best of times\. They become more so when stacked on top of inequalities and social fragmentation, the rapid clip of technological disruption and dangerous planetary change\. The backlash in some countries to various

<a id="_bookmark12"></a>forms of energy taxation or carbon pricing is a case in point\. However welcome new renewable energy technologies may be at competitive market prices, they carry their own environmental costs and risks, including those related to mining to supply the mate\- rials for the world’s solar panels and wind turbines\.52

People rightly worry about winners and losers when big change is on the horizon\. Yes, the green economy could add more than 24 million jobs world\- wide by 2030\.53 This is an exciting opportunity for people and planet\. But these jobs will not necessarily be in the same regions that stand to lose jobs as fos\- sil fuel industries shut down\. Nor will they require the same skills as a fossil fuel–based economy\. No one seems especially interested in a bigger overall pie if his or her piece is feared to be getting much smaller\.

Nor do people need forecasts or history books to know that societal transformations—however well planned or not, however “good” or not—can radical\- ly reshape the communities they live in, often in un\- expected ways where “do\-overs” are not possible if things go wrong\. Many around the world have lived through transformations, some ongoing, in their life\- times\. They see them with their own eyes\. The trans\- formations in energy and materials required now in the Anthropocene portend even more upheavals, which some believe to be as large as the shift from ag\- ricultural to industrial societies\.54

do—in terms of policies, institutions\) and the behav\- iours shaped by social context, culture and narratives \(how to do it—in terms of prevalent identities, values and beliefs\)\. The interplay of forces—their scales, speeds, unknown interactions and consequences— have made development pathways simultaneously far less obvious and far more open\. What should hap\- pen next can no longer be taken for granted\. A line\- ar march of progress in which low\-income countries chase higher income ones is less relevant\. In a sense all countries are developing countries, charting a new planetary course together, regardless of whether they work together to do so\.

In a sense all countries are developing countries, charting a new planetary course together, regardless of whether they work together to do so

“

The question is no longer simply how some coun\- tries get from point A to point B; instead, it is how all countries start moving from wherever they are to points N, T or W—or letters in some new alphabet— and then course correct along the way\. Development is perhaps better seen as a process characterized both by adapting to an unfolding unknown reality and by purposefully transforming economies and societies to ease planetary pressures and advance inclusion\.55

Whether it is the advent of agriculture or the In\-		

dustrial Revolution, previous tectonic shifts have typically stretched across multiple generations\. Now, they can happen within a generation, in a matter of years, introducing a new kind of uncertainty or worry\. Whether through foresight or experience, that will influence how people think about and invest in their lives, families and communities and hold their lead\- ers accountable\. These are not reasons to give up on a green economy; we cannot afford to throw in the towel\. But if we do not understand people’s pres\- ent and future anxieties and address the underlying drivers, if we do not build trust and the promise of a better future, progress towards purposeful, just, sus\- tainable transformations is going to be even harder\.

The net result of today’s uncertainty complex on development is profound\. We might be facing a grow\- ing mismatch between what is needed to navigate novel, interacting uncertainties and the current state of affairs, categorized by social arrangements \(what to

There is promise and opportunity in uncertainty

If necessity is the mother of invention, then the very forces that give rise to today’s uncertainties also offer the means to navigate them\. Uncertainty engenders the possibility of change, also for the better\. Consid\- er artificial intelligence, a disruptive opportunity at least as much as a disruptive threat\. Its potential for enhancing labour is bigger than its potential for au\- tomating it\. New tasks, new jobs, new industries are all possible \(figure 9\)\. Recall that most jobs came into being in part through the task\-creating effects of new technologies: around 60 percent of people in the United States are now employed in occupations that did not exist in 1940\.56 We do not, however, have the luxury to wait around for the long run\. The negative displacement impacts of artificial intelligence are too big, too likely and too fast, especially if labour\-replac\- ing incentives dominate its development\. Policies

and institutions must be put into place that nudge ar\- tificial intelligence towards people rather than away from them, to unlock and frontload its potential for positive transformation\.

We are already witnessing artificial intelligence’s upside in many areas \(see chapter 5\)\. Among its many climate\-related applications, it aids in modelling cli\- mate change impacts and in predicting disasters\. In education it can facilitate individualized learning and enhance accessibility\. In biology it has revolutionized protein folding prediction, a huge boon for medicine\.57 Among the many things the Covid\-19 pandemic broke open was our imaginations\. It expanded the reference points for what is possible \(see chapter 5\)\. Consider the rapid development and distribution in many \(but not all\) countries of safe, effective Covid\- 19 vaccines, some based on new mRNA technologies that hold promise for preventing and treating many other diseases\. The pandemic normalized paid sick leave, voluntary social distancing and self\-isolation,

all important for our response to future pandemics\.

The interventions by central banks over the past two years dwarf their interventions in the wake of the global financial crisis about a decade earlier\. Fis\- cal policy saw a sea change, too\. Social protection

has surged, protecting many people from even worse impacts of the Covid\-19 pandemic while pro\- viding large\-scale test cases of innovative ideas: linking national registries and databases for eligibil\- ity determination; expanding coverage to previously uncovered beneficiaries, such as refugees, migrants and informal workers; and adopting digital verifica\- tion and delivery systems, among other pathbreak\- ing steps\.58

Civil society has been breaking new ground, too\. In many places the Covid\-19 pandemic galvanized civil society organizations to deliver emergency respons\- es, in some cases taking on new functions\.59 In re\- sponse to expanded emergency government powers, some civil society entities have beefed up watchdog activities, and still others are pushing to address so\- cial, economic and political imbalances laid bare by the pandemic\.

As the Covid\-19 pandemic has shown, the growing mismatch between the world as it is \(or is becoming\) and conventional ways of understanding and doing things, such that more and more of life lacks an ob\- vious compass or structure, can be seen as an oppor\- tunity to do something new\. It can be an opportunity to imagine, experiment and create, in ways similar to

the work of a scientist or artist\. Existing institutions can be transformed, and new ones created, alongside new leaders, social movements and norms\. Much like many scientists and artists, who are often responding to practical personal and societal concerns, this pro\- cess of ongoing, creative reconstruction at all levels is a practical response to today’s uncertainty com\- plex\. We will have to find ways to renew, adapt and create institutions in the face of their inevitable short\- comings in an unpredictably changing world\. We will have to experiment, to cooperate, in order to thrive\.

If we do not—if we reinforce the status quo, when the status quo is part of the problem, or limit our as\- pirations to a “return to normal”—the gap between a changing world and intractable norms and institu\- tions will widen to a chasm\. Opportunities for inno\- vation and good leadership then increasingly become dangerous vacuums in power where the allure of sim\- ple recipes and the easy gratifications of finger point\- ing combine to make the problem worse\. There is promise and peril in uncertainty and disruption; tip\- ping the scales towards promise—towards hope—is up to us\.

An evolving portfolio of perspectives helps in a world of worry

Tipping the scales towards promise requires that we keep testing the fences of conventional thinking, to embrace an evolving portfolio of perspectives from which to draw, mixing and matching as emerging contexts require\. For instance, policies and institu\- tions at all levels need to go beyond assuming that people are only, or even predominantly, self\-inter\- ested \(see chapter 3\)\. This assumption remains high\- ly relevant, but it is does not encompass the totality of human behaviour\. Its limitations have been high\- lighted and addressed, at least partially, by com\- plementary and pioneering work in behavioural economics\. Still, we must reach for broader perspec\- tives of human decisionmaking, ones that consider the roles of emotions and culture and that explore how people weave together and change value\-infused narratives about themselves and the various commu\- nities they belong to\. For example, our relationship with nature needs renovation, and cultural narratives are the foundation\.

To respond creatively and nimbly to today’s uncertainty complex, we need to bring down barriers to people’s imaginations, identities and networks, to expand the

idea of what is possible in people’s lives

“

Just as we must widen the vista on human behav\- iour, notions of human development must go beyond a focus on wellbeing achievements, however impor\- tant they still are, to include the vital roles of agency and freedoms in helping people live lives that they value \(see chapter 3\)\. Doing so illuminates the appar\- ent paradoxes of our age: progress with insecurity and progress with polarization\. A comprehensive embrace of human development can act as a lodestar through turbulent times when cookie\-cutter policy lists sim\- ply will not do\. To respond creatively and nimbly to today’s uncertainty complex, we need to bring down barriers to people’s imaginations, identities and net\- works, to expand the idea of what is possible in peo\- ple’s lives\. While crises can present opportunities for pathbreaking action, we will be better off operating deliberately and proactively rather than in a chronic state of emergency response\. In an age of layered and interacting uncertainties, freedoms may not translate reliably into desired achievements or outcomes\. That is the unfortunate news\. But individuals, families and communities can be empowered to experiment, to try new things, for their benefit and for others, without fear of being trapped in poverty, in a single identity or in one cultural narrative\.

Rigidities in their many dimensions—in ideas, in networks, in narratives—act as a vise on human cre\- ativity; they constrain the generation of new ideas in response to a changing world\. Agency and free\- doms are antidotes\. Policies, institutions and cultur\- al change that promote them tend to be fostered by cultivating four motivating principles: flexibility, sol\- idarity, creativity and inclusion \(see also chapter 6\)\. These principles, which can reinforce one another, will go a long way in making policies and institutions more fit for purpose\.

The four principles can also have their own inter\- nal tensions\. Building systems with some stabilizing redundancies, for example, needs to be balanced against nimble response capacities\. Still, it is hard to be quick on one’s feet if one is constantly getting knocked over by a financial meltdown, novel virus or

<a id="_bookmark14"></a>monster hurricane\. Similarly, there is a give and take to creative exploration and concerted, purposeful action anchored in human rights\. Striking the right balance among the four motivating principles will be key, and trust is essential to doing so\. People will be suspicious of the negotiation table if they fear that the chair will be constantly jerked out from under them\. Policy development will be an iterative, trial\-and\-er\- ror process in which we must all learn from each other\.

Policies and institutions to invest, insure and innovate

There are no policy panaceas, no one\-size\-fits\-all approaches\. Even so, some policies form the build\- ing blocks for countries and communities as they navigate today’s uncertainty complex towards more hopeful futures\. They fall into three overlapping, mu\- tually reinforcing categories: investment, insurance and innovation—the Three I’s \(figure 10; see also chapter 6\)\.

Investment should connect the dots\. Nature\-based human development can protect and enhance natural resources while protecting people from shocks, pro\- moting economic and food security and expanding the choices available to them\. Such investments are especially relevant at the local level, speaking to the

need for investing in governance that is connected to people on the ground, that builds bridges among pol\- icy and institutional silos and that ensures all voices are heard\. Investments are needed, too, on the other end—in global public goods\. The new uncertain\- ty complex is often driven by global phenomena, so responding to it can require global cooperation\. The additional investment to avoid future pandemics is estimated to be only $15 billion a year\.60 This is a tiny fraction of the economic cost of the Covid\-19 pan\- demic, a cost that exceeds $7 trillion in lost produc\- tion and $16\.9 trillion in emergency fiscal responses\.61 Investments in global pandemic preparedness make good sense, given the devastating human costs\.

Insurance provides an essential stabilizing force in the face of uncertainty\. To start, structures that manage a variety of risk in people’s lives, primarily in various forms of social protection, need to be re\- vitalized and modernized, including for people in in\- formal or other precarious employment, such as gig workers\. We need to reverse course away from risk segmentation and move towards a broader sharing of risk\. More countercyclical social protection measures can be automatically triggered by certain indicators, such as the loss of a job or a drop in income, while ensuring their inclusivity\. Such measures played im\- portant roles in many countries in protecting people from some of the worst impacts of the global financial

<a id="_bookmark15"></a>crisis and the Covid\-19 pandemic\. One of the bene\- fits of automatic triggers is that they require less polit\- ical wrangling at already stressful moments, helping target political capital to the unique features of a new challenge rather than continually plugging holes in leaky safety nets\.

Universal basic services, such as health and edu\- cation, are important investments in their own right, as evidenced in the Sustainable Development Goals, and for inclusively expanding human development\. They also afford an important insurance function, helping stabilize people in the face of seemingly re\- lentless shocks\. This can encourage experimentation\. People are loath to try new things if doing so risks their or their family’s health and education and threatens to yank them irreversibly down a yawning socioeconomic ladder\.

Innovation will be at the heart of successfully navigating the many unforeseen, unknowable challenges ahead

“

Investments in preparedness, not just for shocks but also for societal transitions, can be well worth the cost\. Equally important are investments in promot\- ing and protecting human rights and in deliberative mechanisms that enable public reasoning in a par\- ticipatory, inclusive way\. Together they help insure against polarization\.

Innovation will be at the heart of successfully navi\- gating the many unforeseen, unknowable challenges ahead\. Some readymade tools will help, others will be modified and updated for new contexts and still oth\- ers will be built from scratch\. In part, innovation has to do with new technologies and ensuring that they reach everyone\. Computational capacities amount\- ing to millions of Apollo missions to the moon are now in the hands of everyone with a smartphone, which is just about everybody\.62 In developing coun\- tries mobile phones have reshaped financial transfers and access to information, such as weather forecasts and wholesale market prices\. New insurance models are needed that respond to complex new risk para\- digms: risks that are increasingly synchronized across geographies and sectors, that span generations and that harm natural resources\.

The “right” role for governments in innovation is an important question, and governments have big

roles in fostering climates for innovation\. There was widespread support when governments threw their full weight behind Covid\-19 vaccines, committing to staggering prepurchase orders of then\-unprov\- en technologies\. Governments were a driving force and active development and distribution partner throughout, ushering in and deploying a lifesaving new technology at astonishing speed\. \(The contrast with the relatively anaemic action on climate change, no less an emergency than Covid\-19, is stark\.\) Inno\- vation policy frameworks, which are intimately tied to other areas such as competition and patent laws, have enormous implications across sectors, from access to medicines and energy to food and water security\.

Innovation does not have to be big to produce big results\. Major social media platforms have enact\- ed policies such as notices, warnings and links to resources in a bid to combat misinformation\. For example, links to official information by the World Health Organization are suggested under posts men\- tioning Covid\-19 on Instagram, Facebook, YouTube and TikTok\. Twitter reminds users when they are sharing an article without opening the link first \(see chapter 4\)\. Fact\-checking initiatives have been cre\- ated by users on these same platforms, and media plurality has been strengthened through new and independent outlets that could not exist or have the means to inform in the traditional media landscape, often at the local and grassroot levels\. Governments can also take prudent steps to combat misinforma\- tion while respecting and promoting people’s human rights and freedoms\.

Sometimes the answer might not be complex\. The simple addition of the retweet button on Twitter has enabled information, including misinformation, to go viral\. Modifying its use, as some have argued, could go a long way in curbing some of the more troubling features of social media\.63 Course correcting in this way—practical solutions to practical problems—will be key to navigating the new uncertainty complex\.

Innovation is more than technologies as we un\- derstand them conventionally in terms of vaccines or smartphones\. Equally important is social innova\- tion, which is a whole\-of\-society endeavour\. Adap\- tive peacebuilding, which focuses on emergent bottom\-up, participatory processes rather than ad\- hering to a set recipe, is a case in point\.64 Much can be

<a id="_bookmark16"></a>learned from its application in Rwanda for healing, transitional justice and conflict resolution \(see chap\- ter 6\)\.

Cultural change opens opportunities for collective action

Policies and institutions are embedded in social con\- texts, so aspects such as narratives matter a lot, too\. Everyone is immersed in social contexts, with cul\- ture understood not as a fixed variable working in the background but as a toolkit that changes over time and that individuals and groups use strategically in society\.

When it comes to choices about the future, people appear to be motivated less by accurate scenarios of what the future may hold than by collectively held narratives\.65 Much of the current information about the future, in the form of assessments, such as those issued by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change or Intergovernmental Science\-Policy Plat\- form on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services,66 are anticipatory\. As crucial as they are, it is important to consider also having assessments towards imagining more desirable futures\.67

The importance of culture is finding its way into many other areas, including economics and law\. The work of Robert Shiller explains dynamics in asset prices as well as business cycles in terms of “narrative economics\.”68 Karla Hoff and James Walsh suggest that law affects behaviour not only by changing in\- centives and information \(a coordination function\) or through its expressive role \(as a guidepost for social

Change campaign made inroads into reducing men\- tal health stigma\.71

The issue is not just about recipients of pro\- grammes or target audiences but also about who is deciding on and delivering the messages\. For exam\- ple, women’s representation in political bodies shifts policy priorities and expands aspirations for other women and girls\. Social movements have important roles as well in advancing human rights and changing cultural norms and narratives to expand agency and freedoms \(see chapter 6\)\.

Walls between our social connections are perhaps more insidiously damaging and polarizing than walls between nations

“

Essential to flexible and adaptable narratives, in building trust and social cohesion for more hopeful futures, is the freedom for each person to have and move among different identities in different social contexts \(see chapter 4\)\.72 Walls between our social connections are perhaps more insidiously damag\- ing and polarizing than walls between nations\. The bridges that connect different groups are among our most important assets\. Good leaders rehabilitate and strengthen them and help us use them— especially in the face of unknowns\. Demagogues try to burn them down, replacing fluid connection, exchange and learning with zero\-sum, us\-versus\-them narra\- tives\. Instead of trying out cultural scripts precisely when experimentation matters most, people become trapped by them\.

norms\) but also with the potential to change cultural		

categories\.69

Shifting culture, for good or ill, is possible and can happen quickly\. Education can be a powerful tool to open the potential for new perspectives in younger generations, not just through curricula but also by en\- visaging schools as spaces of inclusion and diversity\. Social recognition by elites of all types, from politi\- cians and celebrities to social media influencers and community leaders, is an important mechanism for cultural change\. Media in its many forms plays a big role here\. In Bangladesh a popular animated televi\- sion show reduced the cultural and religious stigma of girls going to school in rural areas and increased their attendance\.70 In Ghana and Kenya the Time to

Where we go from here is up to us

We must learn to live with today’s uncertainty com\- plex, just as we must learn to live with Covid\-19\. This year’s Human Development Report challenges us to aspire to more than mere accommodation, however\. By unlocking our human potential, by tapping into our creativity and diversity anchored in trust and sol\- idarity, it challenges us to imagine and create futures in which we thrive\. The encouraging words of the late, great poet and civil rights activist Maya Angelou ring as true as ever, reminding us “to bring all our en\- ergies to each encounter, to remain flexible enough to notice and admit when what we expected to happen

<a id="_bookmark17"></a>did not happen\. We need to remember that we are created creative and can invent new scenarios as fre\- quently as they are needed\.”73

Where we go from here is up to us\. One of the great lessons of our species’ history is that we can accom\- plish a lot with very little if we work together towards shared goals\. If there is a secret ingredient to human magic, that must be it\. The challenges in the Anthro\- pocene and in sweeping societal transformations are huge, even daunting, all the more so for countries and communities struggling with the most dramatic and unjust deprivations\. Insecurity and polarization make

things worse\. Amid so much uncertainty, the truth is that we are not going to get it right, maybe not even most of the time\. In this turbulent new era we can set the direction but cannot guarantee the outcome\. The good news is that we have more tools than ever to help us navigate and course correct\. But no amount of technological wizardry is a substitute for good lead\- ership, collective action or trust\. If we can start fixing the human side of the planetary ledger—and this Re\- port tries to highlight how—then the future, however uncertain, will be more promise than peril, just as it should be\.

##### Uncertain times, unsettled lives

24	HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2021/2022 

Uncertainty is not new, but its dimensions today are taking ominous new forms\. A new “uncertainty com\- plex” is emerging, never seen before in human histo\- ry\. Part I of this Human Development Report explores what this uncertainty complex is, how it is unsettling lives the world over and what it has to do with human development\. Chapter 1 parses the three volatile, in\- teracting strands that constitute the uncertainty com\- plex: the planetary pressures and inequalities of the Anthropocene, the pursuit of societal transformations

to ease those pressures and widespread polarization across and within countries\. Chapter 2 illuminates how uncertainties of all stripes constrain human de\- velopment via their negative impacts on mental well\- being\. Chapter 3 argues that narrow assumptions about human behavior, alongside simplistic notions of development progress, limit people’s ability to re\- spond creatively to a world in flux\. Doubling down on human development in its fullest sense offers a hope\- ful path forward in uncertain times\.

A new uncertainty complex

Feelings of distress have been on the rise for almost everyone everywhere, even before the Covid\-19

pandemic\. Yet conventional measures of wellbeing suggest that, on average, life has never been better for our species\.

What is going on? Why are people so worried, and what worries them?

This chapter argues that a new uncertainty complex is emerging, driven by three novel sources of

uncertainty that interact at a global scale:

- The intertwined planetary pressures and inequalities of the Anthropocene\.
- The pursuit of just societal transformations to ease those pressures\.
- Widespread, intensifying societal polarization, delaying necessary action for change\.

Together, they are painting a picture of uncertain times and unsettled lives\.

28	HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2021/2022 

<a id="_bookmark20"></a>A world of worry in uncertain times

A war between countries in Europe reawakens fear of global nuclear conflagration\. A volatile geopoliti\- cal context1 coexists with a pandemic that continues to kill and frighten more than two years since it was declared\. Behind the headlines progress in human development has gone into reverse—with worsening trends in poverty, food insecurity, forced displace\- ment and many compounding inequalities\.2 For the first time on record, the global Human Development Index \(HDI\) has dropped for two years in a row, taking the world back to just after the adoption of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Paris Agreement \(figure 1\.1\)\. Every year a few countries face declines on the HDI, but over 90 percent of countries saw their HDI value drop in either 2020 or 2021 \(fig\- ure 1\.2\)\. Furthermore, while only a third of very high HDI countries saw a decline in 2021 \(compared with over 90 percent in 2020\), about 60 percent of low and medium HDI and high HDI countries did \(figure 1\.3\)\.

There is little doubt that these are uncertain times,3 as people feel less sure about what the future holds\. Even before the Covid\-19 pandemic hit, six of seven

people in the world reported feeling insecure about many aspects of their lives, with concerns rising the most in very high HDI countries \(see chapters 3 and 4 on the links between uncertainty and insecurity\)\.4

Life has always been uncertain\.5 The world has faced wars, pandemics and massive natural hazards before\. Today’s uncertainty is not necessarily any greater than in the past\. If anything, given record achievements in average standards of living and in\- comes, with astonishing technological progress, we could be expected to be more ready than ever to meet uncertain times\. Yet, we display high, and often ris\- ing, concern about the future\. So, what is going on? Why are people so worried, and what worries them? If today’s world is not more uncertain than the past’s, are today’s uncertain times different? If so, how? And how do they relate to human development?

This chapter presents evidence that people are feeling distressed and explores what they may be worrying about\. While it cannot be established that there is more uncertainty today than in the past, there is a novel context for uncertainty\. The novelty comes from three interacting layers of uncertainty, super\- imposed on ongoing development challenges\. The

first is associated with the Anthropocene’s dangerous planetary change and its interaction with inequalities\. The second is the purposeful efforts and intentions to transition towards new ways of organizing industri\- al societies—purporting transformations similar to those in the transition from agricultural to industrial societies\.6 The third is the intensification of political and social polarization across and within countries— and of misperceptions about information and across

groups of people—facilitated by how new digital tech\- nologies are often being used\.7 This new and interact\- ing “uncertainty complex” is unequal and universal; it can exacerbate inequalities, yet like the ongoing pandemic, it touches us all\.

The interaction of these three layers of uncertainty implies that threats to people and planet compound, with events rippling through our socially and ecologi\- cally connected societies in multiple and unpredictable

<a id="_bookmark22"></a>ways\. Consider how the war in Ukraine is compound\- ing a global food insecurity crisis\.8 Consider how the Covid\-19 pandemic, in addition to the health impacts, also devastated economies and reversed progress in gender equality\.9 Many of the threats, in isolation, are not new\. But the confluence of pandemics, the inven\- tion of vaccines in record time, the digital proliferation of misinformation, the breakdown of supply chains, the strong market concentrations for essential goods, the loss of biodiversity—have all interacted to present a “complex mixture of the precedented and the un\- precedented” at a speed and scale never before seen\.10

Rising insecurity amid unprecedented material prosperity—for some

Large\-scale text analysis identifying language trends in books over the past 125 years reveals a sharp in\- crease in expressions reflecting cognitive distortions associated with depression and other forms of mental distress \(see chapter 2\)\.11 Over the past two decades the language reflecting overly negative perceptions of the world and its future has surged \(figure 1\.4\)\.12 In\- deed, today’s distress levels are unprecedented,13 ex\- ceeding those during the Great Depression and both

world wars\. The analysis of more than 14 million books in three languages signals cultural, linguis\- tic and psychological shifts beyond changes in word meaning, writing and publishing standards or the books considered\. Indeed, literature has been thought of as mirror of our societies, and studies show that text expressions reflect emotional states14 and some\- times anticipate broader social and political changes\.15 Other studies—on, for example, online behav\- iour16 and analysis of emotional expressions on social media17— echo these findings\.18 The Covid\-19 pan\- demic and uncertainty about the impacts and spread of the disease sparked rapid surges in online search\- es for acute and health\- and economic\-related anxie\- ty\.19 While reflecting the concerns of only those with internet access, the measures coincide with survey data20 across geographic locations\.21 Still other stud\- ies show that when events are sudden or unexpected,

online behaviour can indicate shared sentiments\.22 People report feeling more distressed and insecure

about their lives and the future\. While perceived in\- security is higher in low and medium HDI countries, some of the largest increases in feelings of insecuri\- ty are in very high HDI countries \(figure 1\.5\)\.23 Inse\- curity, discontent and pessimism loom large across

all geographic regions, including countries with the highest incomes, with some surveys finding that younger people tend to have a more positive outlook on the future in some lower\-income countries\.24 For instance, while the mentions of threats, such as those from conflict or natural hazards, in US newspapers steadily declined from 1900 to about 2010, they have since shot up, with forecasts of further increases in coming decades\.25

The numbers of people reporting negative affect— stress, sadness, anger or worry and experiencing physi\- cal pain—have been on the rise for the past decade and have hit a record high since the Gallup Global Emotions Report started assessing these experiences in 2006\.26 When excluding physical pain and assessing only feel\- ings, research finds that all groups report experiencing negative affect, with women, people with lower than tertiary education and people who are underemployed or unemployed reporting higher absolute levels \(figure 1\.6\)\. Indeed, a trend of increased stress is discernible across the world and across socioeconomic groups, de\- spite volatility from year to year \(figure 1\.7\)\.27

These patterns of high or increasing worry par\- allel improvements in some measures of prosperi\- ty, such as the global Human Development Index, which before the Covid\-19 pandemic had reached record highs\.28 The human development perspective can shed light on this seeming puzzle\. Human devel\- opment is in part about achievements in wellbeing \(in health, education and standards of living\), a cru\- cial aspect of people’s capabilities: their ability to be and do what they value and have reason to value\. But chapter 3 considers other aspects of capabilities that matter beyond wellbeing achievements\. Looking be\- yond averages, horizontal inequalities in capabilities across groups—reflected, say, in gender and racial discrimination or in dimensions important for life in the 21st century, including enhanced capabilities such as higher education and access to broadband29

—persisted and in many cases widened during the pandemic\.

And even progress in basic capabilities has stalled or reversed\. The Covid\-19 pandemic set back the re\- duction in global extreme poverty, disrupting the

steady decline in the number of people living in ex\- treme poverty since 1990\. Over the pandemic’s first two years an additional 110–150 million people may have been pushed into extreme poverty, adding to the 689 million people worldwide forced to survive on less than $1\.90 a day in 2018\.30 Even before the

pandemic, the pace of poverty reduction was slowing

—from about 1 percentage point a year in 1990–2015 to half a percentage point a year in 2015–2017\.

What is more, at least 1\.3 billion people live in mul\- tidimensional poverty, facing deprivations in dimen\- sions important for human development—including

health, education and material standards of living\. Half of them are children\.31 And while child mortali\- ty has declined globally since 1990, children born in the world’s poorest countries in the world still have a 1 in 10 risk of not surviving to their fifth birthday, whereas almost all children born in some of the rich\- est countries survive beyond their fifth birthday\.32 The long\-term effects of the Covid\-19 pandemic and the current inflation in consumer goods prices— especially the increased price of food compounded by the war in the Ukraine—threaten to exacerbate the situation for people living in, or on the brink of, pov\- erty across the world\.

These deprivations and inequalities in capabilities pose serious challenges on their own but matter even more when people try to navigate uncertain times—and they matter not only to those excluded and left behind\. Indeed, the feedback loops between pre\-existing devel\- opment challenges and a novel context of uncertainty “constitute a systemic challenge to social progress\.”33 That provides even more reason to explore why so many people—even if they have met their basic needs

—perceive themselves as lacking agency \(see chapter 3 for a discussion of agency in the human development

framework\) as they look to the future\. Doing so requires understanding what is novel about today’s uncertain times—the new planetary reality of the Anthropocene, the unprecedented transition from industrial societies and the new forms of political polarization\.

Uncertainty driven by dangerous planetary change in the Anthropocene

Never have so many of the planet’s systems been knowingly affected by a single species\. We humans are driving climate change34 and harming the integri\- ty of many of the ecosystems that sustain human lives and other species\. Our choices are shaping the evolu\- tion of life on Earth through legacies that will unfold over millions of years to come\.35

Climate change, biodiversity loss and many other environmental challenges—from air pollution to plastics use—are receiving individual attention\. But the way these and other planetary pressures are interlinked—and the speed, scale and scope of the unprecedented planetary changes unfolding as a result—has motivated a new framing of this current context as the Anthropocene—the age of humans, where humans’ impact on the planet is so stark that it is driving dangerous planetary change—which has been formally proposed as a new geological epoch\.36

The threats to human lives in the Anthropocene are fundamentally unequal, as they will more quickly and intensely affect people and countries that have con\- tributed less in relative and absolute terms to plane\- tary pressures and benefited less from the changes that drive planetary pressures\. As the 2020 Human Devel\- opment Report argued, large and often growing ine\- qualities and power imbalances are a defining feature of the Anthropocene, underpinning the destabilizing dynamics that divert policy attention and may delay action to ease planetary pressures\. But given that the threats emanating from dangerous planetary change are driven mainly by humans, the Anthropocene con\- text is creating a responsibility for humanity to act\.37

If humans have the power to change the planet in harmful and unequalizing ways, they have the obli\- gation to act towards pursuing a safer and more just world\.38 The responsibility to act falls more heavily on those who account for more of the planetary pres\- sures and have more power to change course\. People are not inherently destroyers of nature; they have

<a id="_bookmark26"></a>also shaped ecosystems in mutually beneficial ways\.39 So the Anthropocene provides us with not only the re\- sponsibility but also the opportunity to pursue human development while easing planetary pressures—the central message of the 2020 Report\.

A new planetary reality

Uncertainty in the Anthropocene is about much more than climate change\. Even with advances in science and computational power,40 the multiple feedback loops between social and ecological systems may imply that our “knowledge of the world, its ecosys\- tems and people, their behaviour, values and choices will always be partial\.”41 One key unknown is wheth\- er people will appreciate, and take the responsibility to act on, the power that we have to stop disrupting planetary processes\. Thus, the Anthropocene is char\- acterized by far\-reaching and complex interactions between social and planetary systems that engender a layer of novel uncertainty\.42

Beyond warming temperatures,43 human\-induced planetary pressures result in a natural environment profoundly different from what humans have pre\- viously experienced \(spotlight 1\.1\)\. The frequency and intensity of extreme storms, droughts, wildfires and heatwaves have increased since the 1950s\.44 The intensification of urbanization and agricultur\- al production has disrupted forests, wetlands and grasslands—so much that the amount of human\- made materials, such as concrete and asphalt, now outweigh the Earth’s biomass\.45 More than 1 million species face extinction, threatening the integrity of whole ecosystems\.46

The Anthropocene is characterized by far\-reaching and complex interactions between social and planetary systems that engender a layer of novel uncertainty

“

These phenomena reinforce each other, magnifying the speed and scale of threats to our natural and social systems\. For example, the warming and acidification of oceans provoke migration of fish stocks, affecting food supplies and the livelihoods of coastal communi\- ties\. Food insecurity and eroded livelihoods can then prompt migration, change land uses and exacerbate

pollution, further weakening ecosystems\.47 As anoth\- er example, zoonotic diseases are a latent threat: more than 10,000 virus species have the potential to infect humans\.48 These have so far been contained within wild animal populations, but with accelerated climate change and increased human interference with zo\- onotic reservoirs, animal to human transmission is ex\- pected to increase49 and heighten the risk of new and more frequent pandemics\.50 For example, the intensi\- fied human intervention in animal habitats due to ag\- ricultural production is associated with more than half of all zoonotic diseases infecting humans since 1940\.51 And climate change may alter the pattern of disease exposure and infections as warmer temperatures change the range of disease\-carrying insects\.52

More volatility is also expected\. Climate change is predicted to increase both average temperatures and temperature variability, with temperature fluctu\- ations projected to increase by 100 percent at lower latitudes\.53 More than 40 percent of the world’s pop\- ulation depends on water sources affected by high climate variability\. By 2080 an estimated 1 billion additional people are expected to be impacted by high climate variability and climate\-related water security threats\.54 High weather variability reduces the “ability of economic agents to plan and function effectively”55 and may impair health56 and econom\- ic productivity\.57 For example, intraday and interday temperature variability is associated with increased mortality risk\.58 Many lower\-income countries are disproportionately exposed to increased temperature fluctuations and lack resources to invest in adapta\- tion, leaving them more vulnerable\.59

Dangerous planetary changes are shifting the baseline of hazards,60 but because these changes are driven largely by humans, our choices matter\. The uncertainty related to the range of possible evolu\- tions in emissions61 is driven by both the evolution of the climate system and its interaction with the choic\- es we make\. Implementing the Paris Agreement in a timely manner increases the world’s chances of keep\- ing global average temperature increases below 2°C \(figure 1\.8\)\.62 For example, the difference between a

1\.5°C and a 2°C increase in global temperature expos\- es an extra 1\.7 billion people to extreme heatwaves\.63

The uncertainty about dangerous planetary change does not spell unavoidable doom and societal col\- lapse\.64 A balanced reading of the historical record

<a id="_bookmark27"></a>suggests that human societies have, for the most part, been resilient, flexible and able to respond, adapt and thrive when confronting major environmental chang\- es \(see spotlight 1\.1\)\.65 Even though the evidence per\- tains to circumscribed geographic contexts, there is reason to believe that even if not all response options are fully available—for instance, migration when there will be fewer areas with temperatures suitable for human thriving66—people retain their ability to adjust and respond, even to a new planetary reality\.

Unequal contributions, unequal impacts—planetary pressures and social imbalances reinforcing each other

Countries and groups of people that have contributed less to planetary pressures are projected to bear the

largest burdens of dangerous planetary change\.67 For example, mortality and reductions in labour produc\- tivity due to warming temperatures will be greater in low\- and middle\-income countries,68 leaving them with fewer resources to adapt to planetary pressures and adding layers of vulnerability\.

Moreover, climate change is an inequality mul\- tiplier\. Consider the stark inequalities in contribu\- tions to and impacts of carbon dioxide emissions\. The top 10 percent of the global income distribution is responsible for almost half of global annual emis\- sions, and the bottom 50 percent, only 12 percent of emissions\.69 The inequalities run even deeper at the top\. In 2019 the bottom 50 percent accounted for

1\.6 tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions per capita, while the top 10 percent accounted for 31 tonnes per capita, the top 0\.1 percent 467 tonnes per capita and

The channel through which planetary pressures are affected by inequality runs through actual choices as well as through aspirations

“

Those contributing the least to climate change find themselves at the losing end\. Unmitigated climate change may drive up to 132 million people into pov\- erty in the coming decade\.73 Planetary pressures may also exacerbate horizontal inequalities or even open new gaps between groups\.74 For instance, future risks of flooding in the United States are expected to affect

show how demand for large housing, large cars and other large goods has increased even where median incomes are stagnant\.82 If access to these position\- al goods becomes harder and the referent of aspira\- tions is seen to be out of reach, the positive effects of aspiration can instead lead to alienation and frustra\- tion\.83 This mismatch between aspiration and reali\- zation has implications for people’s wellbeing \(it can increase depression\)\.84 But it can also change people’s perception of the future from positive to negative and their sense of agency over the future from high to low85—leading to more pessimistic views\. As a result, there will be less of a concern about how individual behaviour affects future outcomes\. And alienation and frustration can, in turn, contribute to polariza\- tion, making collective action towards easing plane\- tary pressures more difficult\.

mainly low\-income Black communities\.75 And barri\-		

ers to women’s participation in decisionmaking work against policies and resource allocations that address women’s specific vulnerabilities to environmental change\.76

As seen above, curbing emissions at the top of the income distribution would have a great impact,77 but when those responsible for planetary pressures are not equally affected by them and believe they have the resources to shield themselves from the adverse effects, incentives to ease planetary pressures are dis\- torted\. The choices of high\-income earners are as\- sociated with consumption and production patterns that account for a disproportionate share of plane\- tary pressures\. These choices are driven by many fac\- tors, but social norms among high\-earners and peer effects influence the lifestyles they expect\.78 Their social context determines not only choices but also aspirations\.79

The channel through which planetary pressures are affected by inequality runs through actual choices as well as through aspirations\. Aspirations can play an important role as an incentive for effort with positive individual and collective outcomes80 and in enhanc\- ing human development\.81 The reference frames of aspirations for adjacent, but lower, income groups are influenced by the behaviour of higher earners\. As reference points change, more and more people may be influenced to behave in ways that add to planetary pressures\. Such dynamic “expenditure cascades”

No second chances: Existential threats in the Anthropocene

To see how the uncertainties in the Anthropocene are novel, consider existential threats\. For the first time in human history, anthropogenic existential threats loom larger than those from natural hazards\.86 This started with the advent of nuclear weapons, with escalating technological power reaching the point where we are able to threaten our own destruction\. Nuclear war posed an existential risk:87 the perma\- nent destruction of humanity’s long\-term potential\. Throughout most of human history, the existential risks to our species emanated exclusively from natu\- ral hazards, independent of human action—including large asteroid impacts or massive volcanic events, such as those leading to mass extinction events in the geological timescale\.88 Humans have always had power to inflict much harm on each other and on na\- ture, but only in the Anthropocene have they reached the potential to kill much of the global population and destroy the potential of future societies\.89

The spectrum of anthropogenic existential threats is large and growing\. In addition to the prospect of nuclear war, threats include artificial intelligence \(AI\), genetic engineering and nanotechnology, as well as the dangers of planetary pressures and their interactions\.90 They may be deliberate, as in the use of nuclear force\. Or they may be accidental, such as

<a id="_bookmark29"></a>the spread of a virus from a lab, or they may emerge from ungovernable technological development\.91 Heightened political polarization and conflict may increase the existential threats, including through nuclear war or biological warfare\.92 The drivers of a possible nuclear conflict may be linked, both in exac\- erbating the risks and in magnifying the impacts for human lives and the planet \(spotlight 1\.2\)\.93

Easing planetary pressures would entail a fundamental transformation in how societies live, work and interact with nature\. This transformation engenders its own novel layer of uncertainty, because, like the Anthropocene reality, it is unprecedented and uncharted

“

While the existential risks of nuclear war might be easily imagined, the existential risks of slow\-on\- set climate change or biodiversity loss may not be as evident\. With continued human pressures on the planet, tipping points—beyond return—can inflict ir\- reversible damage to ecosystems and to the benefits humans derive from them\. If tipping points interact, they may have catastrophic and cascading conse\- quences\.94 For example, climate change is provoking Arctic sea\-ice loss, which contributes to a slowdown of the Atlantic circulation, which could disrupt the West African monsoon and trigger drought in the Sahel, dry up the Amazon and warm the Southern Ocean, further accelerating the melting of Antarctic ice\. Amazon forest dieback would distort the stabil\- ity of the Earth’s biosphere, with large\-scale conse\- quences, including massive biodiversity loss and unprecedented rises in carbon dioxide concentra\- tions in the atmosphere\.95 While uncertainty remains about the exact “location” of tipping points and the full consequences of crossing one, they are just “too risky to bet against\.”96

Realizing the power that humans have over our en\- tire planet implies the responsibility to act\. Recogniz\- ing anthropogenic existential threats also provides an obligation to lower, indeed to eliminate, existential risk\. In the same way that the Anthropocene provides a unifying framework to understand how human choices drive planetary pressures that result in dise\- qualizing dangerous planetary change, eliminating existential risk— or promoting existential security— is the ultimate nonrenewable resource and demands

reflecting on the type of institutions needed to reach existential security \(spotlight 1\.3\)\.

Uncertainty emerges from complex transitions to ease planetary pressures

Adapting to the uncertainty brought about by the An\- thropocene reality just described is a tall order\. In addition to adaptation, it is crucial to ease the plan\- etary pressures that are driving dangerous planetary changes\. Easing planetary pressures will also mitigate some of the uncertainties\.97

Easing planetary pressures would entail a funda\- mental transformation in how societies live, work and interact with nature, comparable to the transi\- tions to agricultural societies and from agricultural to industrial societies\.98 That calls for us to work with

—not against—nature \(spotlight 1\.4\)\. This transfor\- mation engenders its own novel layer of uncertainty, because, like the Anthropocene reality, it is unprec\- edented and uncharted\. Uncertainty also emanates from the fact that transformations involve multiple social and ecological factors, and their interactions, playing out over the long term of the transitions at stake\. Even if many of these transitions have in some ways been charted and modelled \(singly or in parts of the world\), there is also modelling and analytical uncertainty\.

Central in all this is transforming how societies generate energy and use materials\.99 That will involve shifting both production and consumption patterns, underpinned by how human behaviour interacts with institutions\. And that interaction shapes, and is shaped by, incentives, social norms and values\.

The 2020 Report proposed representing advancing human development while easing planetary pressures as paths taking countries towards the aspirational space of the green triangle in figure 1\.9\.100 While the world had moved in that direction over the past 30 years, it has done so far too slowly and in a way that leaves higher human development strongly correlat\- ed with greater planetary pressures\. The needed scale and speed of this transition should not be oversimpli\- fied or minimized, given the ambition of the required shifts101—and that, along with complexity of the tran\- sition, adds a new layer of uncertainty\.102

Transitional uncertainty has several dimensions, including those associated with a move towards a

low\-carbon economic development path\.103 Beyond the physical uncertainties of climate change are the uncertainties associated with our deliberate poli\- cy choices—such as altering carbon taxes, shifting economies away from carbon\-intensive industries or adopting new technologies\.104

Some of the uncertainty is associated with who will win and who will lose as the process unfolds, which will likely differ across regions and groups— recognizing that some are better equipped than oth\- ers to benefit from new opportunities\.105 One possible manifestation of uncertainty could be economic inse\- curity \(spotlight 1\.5\)\. For instance, the green econo\- my could add more than 24 million jobs worldwide by 2030\.106 But these jobs will not necessarily be in the same regions that stand to lose jobs as fossil fuel in\- dustries shut down,107 nor will they require the same set of skills as in a fossil fuel–based economy\. The economic gains from phasing out coal could amount to as much as 1\.2 percent of global GDP every year

until 2100—but the question remains about how these gains would be distributed across countries and across individuals\.108 If distributional effects are per\- ceived as unfair or if people are left without the sup\- port to adapt to a new economic reality, transitions may be met with resistance, dissent and dispute\.109

The outcomes of past transitions have been large\- ly unplanned and unintentional\. But the expansion of knowledge and science and our awareness of the An\- thropocene reality imply that the transitions to ease planetary pressures are purposeful and deliberate\. The goal of the transitions is clear—to move to the as\- pirational space of high human development and low planetary pressures— even if much uncertainty re\- mains about the pathways that would take us there\.110 Uncertainties stem not only from the types of pol\- icy choices that are adopted but also from how they are designed and implemented\. Success depends on their perception—on their social acceptance by dif\- ferent segments of the public and those that hold positions of power\. Transitions depend on technol\- ogy, and the resulting efficiency gains from it and how they are distributed\. Explored here are chang\- es required to ease planetary pressures and the layer of uncertainty associated with energy and resource

transitions\.

Energy transitions: Making their way, but too slowly and amid great uncertainties

Energy transitions from fossil fuels towards renewa\- bles are driven by new technologies and lower costs\.111 While fossil fuels such as coal, natural gas and oil still produce two\-thirds of global electricity,112 renewables are expected to become the dominant source of glob\- al energy supply by 2040\.113 But this is only one of many possible future outcomes\. The outcomes vary widely under three scenarios of the International En\- ergy Agency: net\-zero emissions, stated policy sce\- narios and announced pledges to reduce greenhouse gas emissions \(figure 1\.10\)\.

Uncertainty can unfold as consequences emerge\. Biofuels, originally thought to be an excellent alterna\- tive for fossil fuels, also pose a variety of challenges114

—with implications for land use,115 carbon footprint,116 deforestation impacts,117 biodiversity loss,118 water competition119 and poverty impacts,120 among others\.

Uncertainty is also associated with prospects for de\- veloping technologies key to the energy transition, which are not yet in place\. Consider energy storage, which is critical to addressing the intermittency of supply due to daily and seasonal differences in renew\- able power\. While a handful of technologies are avail\- able, much more is needed to enhance technological solutions, lower costs and make transmission more ef\- ficient\. Even with advances in battery storage, adop\- tion remains limited in most low\- and middle\-income countries due to policy, financial and regulatory bar\- riers\. Options sought beyond short\-term energy stor\- age solutions, such as lithium\-ion batteries, include sustainable, cost\-efficient long\-duration energy stor\- age systems, which are a long way off\.121

Another dimension of uncertainty is how the fi\- nancial system, which assumes a stable climate, will evolve\.122 A shift away from carbon\-intensive assets will expose some investors, who may resist and at\- tempt to slow a move towards a low\-carbon path\.123 Governments are now paying more attention to cli\- mate\-related financial risks\. For example, a 2021 ex\- ecutive order by US President Joseph Biden requires clear and accurate disclosure of climate\-related fi\- nancial risks to safeguard physical assets as well as financial markets from climate change–related risks\.124

The objective is to protect communities and families as the United States transitions to the net\-zero emis\- sions target by 2050\.

Global and regional mechanisms are also working to facilitate a low\-carbon transition in the financial sector\. The Task Force for Climate\-Related Financial Disclosure seeks to provide investors with informa\- tion on climate change–related risks in their portfoli\- os\. With the same inspiration a consortium of central banks and financial supervisors established the Net\- work for Greening the Financial System\.125 The EU Taxonomy, which classifies environmentally sus\- tainable economic activities, supports transitioning to net\-zero emissions by 2050 and implementing the European Green Deal; the EU Delegated Act has been formalized to set the screening criteria for the environmental objectives of new economic activities\. And European countries are stepping up various mit\- igation efforts, such as ending the sale of new diesel\- and gas\-powered cars in 14 years and imposing tariffs on goods imported from countries with lax environ\- mental laws\.126

The volatility in oil and gas prices during the Covid\- 19 pandemic and now as the war in Ukraine unfolds is sending shock waves around the world\.127 Oil\- exporting countries experienced large fiscal deficits

<a id="_bookmark32"></a>when oil prices dropped\.128 But a range of factors, including the conflict in Ukraine and economic re\- covery as Covid\-19 concerns have eased, have led to

happening now, backed by policies and supported by social movements\.141

a rapid increase in oil prices, a boon to oil\-exporting		

countries but also a driver of inflation almost everywhere\.129

The uncertainty associated with energy transi\- tions has unsettled people who perceive it as unjust\. French villages and small towns saw protests against rising petrol prices again in 2021, reminiscent of the “yellow vest” movements of 2018, Spain saw demon\- strations against energy bills and Greece faced social unrest with the closure of coal mines\.130 This even as a large numbers of jobs are being created in the renew\- able energy sector\.131 Yet while it is anticipated that more jobs will be created than lost in energy transi\- tions, whether the transitions will be just will depend on how they are managed\.132

Current global pledges to reduce greenhouse gas emissions cannot safeguard against dangerous cli\- mate change\.133 Carbon prices remain far too low to effectively curb emissions\. Only 22 percent of global carbon emissions are under a carbon pricing scheme\.134 And implementation remains a challenge even for commitments made to phase out fossil fuel subsidies

—no date has been set to achieve the target globally, and 2021 saw the highest increase in fossil fuel sub\- sidies since 2010\.135 Uncertainty associated with the transition can be heightened by the realization that more ambition is needed, along with the resistance to change from powerful lobby groups or public con\- cerns with loss of employment in specific sectors\.136 And the transitions can be drawn out: phasing out coal in Germany, initiated in the 1980s, is still years from completion, with concerns about stranded assets and the insecurity of affected workers and communities\.137

Deliberate energy transitions are happening now, backed by policies and supported by social movements

“

Even so, energy transitions are possible\.138 A move in France to increase nuclear capacity boosted its share of power from 4 percent in 1970 to 40 percent in 1982\.139 The Netherlands went from having coal supply 55 percent of its power and crude oil 43 per\- cent in 1959 to having natural gas supply 50 per\- cent by 1971\.140 Deliberate energy transitions are

Uncertainty associated with managing material use to ease planetary pressures

The shift to low\-carbon economies will depend in part on extracting minerals and using materials that are key to technologies such as electric cars and solar panels\. The same extraction implies land\-use change and emissions that not only add to planetary pres\- sures but have also been linked with serious human rights violations\.142 For example, rare earth elements can be located in sensitive ecosystems with high bio\- diversity, crucial carbon sinks and water resources, which if exploited could irreversibly damage natu\- ral resources\. Of the 50 million square kilometres of the Earth’s land currently being mined, about 8 per\- cent overlaps with protected areas, 7 percent with key biodiversity areas and 16 percent with the remaining areas free of industrial activities and other human pressures\.143 The next wave of renewable energy growth could affect 30 percent of protected areas and key biodiversity areas and compromise 60 percent of the remaining areas free of industrial activities and other human pressures\.144 Ongoing conflict diverts resources and attention from protecting sensitive ecosystems and vulnerable populations\. With ener\- gy demand projections based on existing policies and policy announcements, mineral demand is expected to double\. And under a sustainable development sce\- nario, where energy policies are consistent with the Paris Agreement goals, mineral demand is expected to quadruple \(figure 1\.11\)\.145

Another dimension of uncertainty is related to the future of seabed and space mining\. Growing demand for renewables is driving mining companies and start\- ups to invest in opportunities under the ocean\.146 Sci\- entists warn that disturbing an otherwise quiet and dark seabed that provides a unique ecosystem for ma\- rine life will have ramifications not only locally but also thousands of kilometres away\. The first experi\- ment in seabed mining in 1989, DISCOL,147 demon\- strated that species did not recolonize after more than 30 years\. With technology ahead of the curve and reg\- ulations catching up, the commercial exploitation of seabed mining could be devastating for marine life\.

And as technology races ahead to make space min\- ing a near possibility, questions are being raised about regulations\.148 There is no legal agreement among nations to prohibit mining celestial bodies; the two treaties in place allow for free exploration and use of space resources, leaving choices to miners\. Moreover, strong pressures to look for answers beyond our own planet may divert attention from ourselves\.149

The demand for materials goes beyond that for the energy transition\. It is adding to planetary pres\- sures with implications that will span deep into the future\. A plastic water bottle can remain in nature for approximately 450 years\.150 And since the 1950s we have produced more than 8 billion tonnes of plastic\.151 In 2020 the world’s consumption of materials ex\- ceeded 100 billion tonnes a year,152 twice the amount

<a id="_bookmark34"></a>in 1995\.153 By 2060 it is expected to be at least three times that in 1995\.154 Only about 8\.6 percent of everything produced is recycled\.155 Human\-produced goods are changing the face of the Earth\. To give a sense of the scale, for the first time in human history, anthropogenic mass exceeded world’s living biomass \(figure 1\.12\)\.156

The challenges with nuclear waste disposal also point to the need to consider material use in a com\- prehensive way\. Nuclear resources that are used to produce clean energy and industrial goods and for military applications also generate radioactive waste, which needs to be stored for more than half a million years—transmitting responsibilities and challenges to distant generations\.157 Much of the waste is temporar\-

Anthropogenic activities are also disrupting bioge\- ochemical cycles\. Carbon levels are 36 times higher than preindustrial levels, phosphorous levels 13 times higher and nitrogen levels 9 times higher\.159 The ni\- trogen in fertilizers accumulating in nature pollutes water \(excessive nitrates in drinking water\), reduces air quality, depletes the ozone layer and accelerates global warming and biodiversity loss\.160 The exces\- sive runoff of nitrogen into rivers and oceans increas\- es algae blooms, which are depleting ocean oxygen and killing aquatic flora and fauna\. Satellite images suggest that about 1\.15 million square kilometres of the ocean surface may be eutrophic zones,161 with a large part of them dead zones\.162

ily stored underground in tanks, which through wear		

and tear may leak radioactive material into our soils and water\. About 95 percent of the world’s nuclear power reactors have produced an estimated 265,000 metric tonnes of spent heavy\-metal fuel and 38 mil\- lion cubic metres of solid nuclear waste\.158

<a id="_bookmark35"></a>other, creating more novel uncertainties\.163 The po\- tential gains are massive, but what about the distri\- bution of benefits and the differentiated impacts on people? The eventual emergence of general\-purpose AI could multiply global GDP per person by a factor of 10—something that historically took the world 190 years to accomplish, from 1820 to 2010\.164 But these massive potential aggregate gains may be con\- centrated among a few, leaving many behind\. One possibility is falling into a Turing trap, where tech\- nological and economic power is concentrated and translated into political power, “trapping a powerless majority into an unhappy equilibrium\.”165 The back\- lash against free trade in some high\-income coun\- tries offers a cautionary tale, given that the aggregate income gains of globalization through comparative advantage and specialization were not distributed to compensate disadvantaged occupations, sectors or regions\. The economic winners gained power and lost interest in ensuring the equitable distribution of benefits\.166

social media and other new technologies are changing our lives in fundamental ways

Recent technological changes outpace our ability to understand their societal implications\. Often dis\- ruptive, AI, social media and other new technologies are changing our lives in fundamental ways\.

To illustrate the novel dimensions of uncertain\- ty, the following sections briefly consider the digital age, AI and genetic editing; see chapters 4 and 5 for further analysis of the implications of technological change\.

__*The digital world—transforming human\-to\-human interaction*__

Less than 1 percent of the world’s technologically stored information was in a digital format in the late 1980scompared with more than 99 percent by 2012\.167 Whether the way we connect to our work, how we communicate with friends and family or what we do in our free time, digital technology has become an in\- dispensable part of many people’s lives\. In 2010 the

number of machines connected to the internet ex\- ceeded the number of people connected to it for the first time\.168 Unlike any previous generation, many children born after 2008 have extensive exposure to digital devices early in life\.

Tempering the initial optimism about the oppor\- tunities of new technologies are downsides or un\- intended consequences\. Mobile phones trace our movements\. AI, reducing human effort in sophisti\- cated tasks, can also replicate and amplify stereo\- types\. Social media, originally meant to connect us, are contributing to divisiveness\. These illustrate how new technologies bring along unintended conse\- quences, engendering uncertainty\.169

Firms are bringing in new technologies at an ac\- celerated pace to automate production and reduce costs\. Some jobs are being lost, as in accounting, administration and translation, just as others are created in big data, digital security and robotics en\- gineering\. The World Economic Forum projects that by 2025, 97 million new jobs will be created and 85 million jobs will be lost across 15 industries in 26 economies\.170 Industries not keeping pace with the trend towards automation stand to lose competitive edge, as will labourers who do not acquire new skills to keep pace with the changing labour market\. This may also have implications for low\- and middle\- income countries, which may see a reshoring of jobs\.171

Digitalization is changing human\-to\-technology and human\-to\-human interactions, sometimes radi\- cally\. Online dating is one example of digitalization\- altered human interaction\.172

Human interaction with algorithms has also turned detrimental in many ways\.173 Mobile telephones and social media lift the voices of marginalized and op\- pressed groups but are also tools for those wishing to do harm\.174 Through these platforms groups with extremist and violent ideologies can expand their followings\.175

The constant connectedness to social media can have harmful cognitive and emotional effects\.176 Neu\- roscientists suggest that internet use has altered the way the brain functions, affecting attention and memory and making us less sociable and empathet\- ic\.177 For example, adding a single moral\-emotional word to a tweet increases its retweet rate by 19 per\- cent\.178 A post that includes indignant disagreement

<a id="_bookmark36"></a>obtains twice as many likes and three times as many comments\.179 And the high demand for attention, as through the overuse of social media, reduces the time young people have for constructive reflection, shrink\- ing the space for future imagining or reflecting on personal memories\.180

__*Artificial intelligence—making choices for us*__

As our lives become more dependent on AI—from weather forecasts to financial market transactions to analysing DNA—we are delegating human choices\. AI is choosing the news and information we are ex\- posed to and suggesting what we should buy\.

The use of algorithms in social media results in people’s decreased exposure to counterattitu\- dinal news, facilitating the polarization of views\.181 Among millennials in many parts of the world, so\- cial media outlets are often the dominant source of news about politics and governments\.182 By recom\- mending automated videos and news, manipulative content now easily reaches viewers, amplifying the spread of disinformation\.183 Social media can also fuel populist, nationalist and xenophobic waves across societies\.184

AI is getting better at creating counterfeit infor\- mation and fuelling the spread of disinformation\. Consider how generative adversarial networks cre\- ate counterfeit audios and videos\.185 These technol\- ogies can now be easily used through apps to create deepfakes\. By 2016 more than 50 percent of inter\- net traffic was generated by bots\.186 Indeed, false in\- formation tends to spread more broadly than true information\.187 Social networks can reduce critical assessment and facilitate the diffusion of conspiracy theories\.

As our lives become more dependent on artificial intelligence—from weather forecasts to financial market transactions to analysing DNA—we are delegating human choices

“

In a similar vein, who is responsible for mistaken AI decisions? Credit applications are rejected, and social media posts are deleted based on AI decisions, while mechanisms to contest these decisions are not fully developed\. Many algorithms are opaque, unreg\- ulated and difficult to contest\.188 Pattern\-recognition

algorithms could be applied to target certain people189 or produce disproportional and biased collateral damages due to imperfections in the code or in train\- ing data\.190 The use of AI in the military to deploy autonomous weapons or killer robots raises many questions\.191

Machine learning is also providing firms with mar\- ket information that they have never had before, cre\- ating new avenues for advertising while potentially encroaching on consumer privacy\. When consumers purchase online, they reveal their preferences, and perhaps information about their friends and families, that companies can use to expand market outreach\. Such data, often provided inadvertently by consum\- ers, may transfer information to companies without constraints on how it may be used\.192

__*Genomic editing—redefining the realm of possibilities*__

Genomic editing has revolutionized the life scienc\- es and medicine through the possibility of changing the characteristics of living organisms by altering DNA\. CRISPR can support the treatment of a range of health conditions with relative ease and efficacy\.193 For the first time it is possible to increase the lon\- gevity of children with progeria, a genetic disorder that promotes early aging and to reverse blindness\.194 CRISPR is also being explored for neurodegenerative diseases such as muscular dystrophy, Huntington’s disease and Alzheimer’s disease\.195

Genomic editing also raises questions\. Somatic cell editing can change the genes of a particular patient, while germline editing of egg and sperm cells can carry the treatment to future generations\. Progress in this field has been so rapid that issues around eth\- ics, regulations and societal implications have coun\- tries scrambling to catch up\. Recently, a researcher alarmed the world by confirming that he had edit\- ed the genes of twin babies\.196 There are also many safety concerns\. For example, in an embryo a nucle\- ase may not necessarily cut both copies of the target genes or may start dividing before the corrections are complete\.197 Gene editing in rats, cattle, sheep and pigs also shows that it is possible to delete or disable genes in an embryo\. Bioethicists argue that it is im\- possible to obtain consent on germline editing from an embryo or from future generations\.198

<a id="_bookmark37"></a>Gene editing in the food industry can enhance productivity and make products resilient to weather and disease\.199 Japan recently authorized a genetical\- ly edited tomato variant rich in amino acids \(GABA\) that can induce relaxation and lower blood pressure\.200 Drought\-resistant crops are being developed to keep yields high in times of reduced water supply, and re\- search is under way on whether genetically edited rice could be resistant to flooding\.201

The conjunction of uncertainty and polarization may be paralyzing—delaying action to curb human pressures on the planet

“

How should genetically edited food be regulated and how should consumers be informed? And what about the labelling of genetically edited food? Sev\- eral biotech companies, agribusinesses and food re\- tailers are behind an antilabelling drive, while others advocate otherwise—but until these questions are an\- swered, uncertainty is likely to persist\.202

Uncertainty propelled by polarization: Delaying action, adding conflict

Uncertainty opens space for dispersing beliefs203 and disagreeing on best courses of action\.204 This is not necessarily a problem\. Indeed, when facing un\- predictability, societies tend to leverage aggregate collective knowledge and narratives to mobilize resil\- ience\.205 But uncertainty can also spur political polari\- zation,especiallyamongthoseaversetouncertainty\.206 For example, research finds that in the uncertain af\- termath of a shock, such as a financial crisis, support for political extremes increases\.207 Political polari\- zation reduces generalized trust and divides society into “us” and “them\.” It entrenches opinions, under\- mines public deliberation and may even reach toxic levels, with detrimental effects for democratic free\- doms and human rights\.208

The last decade has seen rapid democratic backslid\- ing and increased political polarization in many socie\- ties \(see chapter 4\)\.209 Trust and belief in democracy have been declining in parallel with increasing author\- itarianism\.210 Political polarization has been increas\- ing across a diverse set of countries \(figure 1\.13\)\.

The conjunction of uncertainty and polarization may be paralyzing— delaying action to curb human

pressures on the planet\. The real paradox of our time may be our inability to act, despite mounting evi\- dence of the distress that human planetary pressures are causing our ecological and social systems\. But when perspectives of the future are uncertain, people may draw different conclusions from the same data,211 and scientific uncertainty can be a basis for political manipulation\.212 Indeed, the spread of disinformation has been found to contribute to deteriorating social attitudes and polarization\.213

In today’s uncertain times cooperation and dia\- logue have often taken a backseat, as armed conflicts and military spending peak\.214 Wars and violent con\- flicts pose direct threats to lives and livelihoods and compounding pre\-existing vulnerabilities\. They add huge layers of uncertainty to people’s lives and im\- pede both individual and collective investments in human development\.215 The number of people living in areas affected by violent conflict was reaching re\- cord levels even before the war in Ukraine\. In 2020 about 1\.2 billion people lived within 50 kilometres of a conflict event, almost half of them \(560 million\) in places outside so\-called fragile contexts\.216 Further\- more, a large share of the increase in the number of people living close to conflict events has occurred in settings where conflict is present but results in fewer than 10 fatalities, indicating a shift towards insecu\- rity and uncertainty that go beyond the most violent and deadly conflicts\.217

Conflict diverts policy attention and resourc\- es from sustainable development and can hamper climate change mitigation and adaptation efforts\.218 Studies point to the twin crisis of conflict and plane\- tary disruption \(spotlight 1\.6\)\. Warming temperatures heighten conflict risks,219 as documented in histo\- ry,220 with temperature surges linked to higher crime and interpersonal violence, even outside armed con\- flict settings\.221 Nature and natural resources are also becoming a source of contestation\.222 But the links between climate and conflict are not straightforward

—they span socioeconomic, political and ecological spheres\.223 Today, some of the places most exposed to climate change coincide with fragile and conflict\- ridden contexts, where resources and the capacity for resilience are already low \(see spotlight 1\.6\)\. Conflict hinders access to much\-needed climate financing in fragile and violent conflict contexts\.224 The low\- carbon transitions under way can add insecurity by

opening new areas of contestation—especially when coupled with unequal power dynamics and uncer\- tainties about land ownership \(spotlight 1\.7\)\.

And now for something completely different: Novel and layered drivers of uncertainty

Uncertainties are stacking up and interacting\. The novelty of humans’ stark impact on the planet, the intentional efforts to transform, the fast pace of tech\- nological innovation and human development’s em\- beddedness in nature invite us to take a step back and consider the feedback loops and interlinkages be\- tween our social and ecological systems\.225 With close interlinkages threats can easily spill over and multi\- ply—leading to systemic failure\.226 The interaction of different layers of uncertainty makes the current context one of systemwide turbulence\.227 Extreme

weather and climate events interact in ever more complex ways, shaped both by physical drivers and by societal contexts\.228 Institutions and behaviours cre\- ate nonphysical interconnections, with implications for the impact of natural hazards and the severity of future extreme events in a series of complex feedback loops \(table 1\.1\)\.

These interactions between physical and societal drivers have always been present at the local level\. But over the 21st century the world will confront a continuously changing baseline, along with more extreme wet and dry precipitation events that will present adaptation challenges far beyond anything already experienced\.229 In fact, the changing “nor\- mal” will be so substantial that, if traditional meas\- ures to identify extreme events are based on what has been considered “normal,” the entire late 21st centu\- ry would be a single large extreme event\.230 In other words the interaction of physical drivers and societal

forces231 is fundamentally shifting both the baseline of hazards and their increased variance\.232 In the past, institutions and behaviours evolved over time to manage the impact of uncertainty and reduce the vulnerabilities to threats\. In the future, patterns of local adaption will be so disrupted as a result of cli\- mate change233 that we may be ill\-equipped to handle nationally and even globally the simultaneous mate\- rialization of multiple threats interacting with one an\- other in compounding and novel ways \(see box S1\.6\.1 in spotlight 1\.6 for one example of a compounding crisis at the national level\)\.

Droughts have rarely, if ever, affected all the major food producing regions at the same time, providing opportunities for “global insurance” through trade\. The decline in food supplies in a drought\-affected region could be compensated for by the supply from other regions free of drought\. Now, the risk of global crop failure will emerge from more frequent spatially concurrent heatwaves and droughts affecting major breadbaskets for wheat, maize and soybean\.234 Today, there is almost zero probability of the four countries that account for the vast majority of global maize ex\- ports suffering simultaneous crop harvest losses great\- er than 10 percent\. But this probability could increase to almost 90 percent under global warming of 4°C\.235 The global impact runs not only through temperature

and changes in hydrological patterns but also through the large changes in global ecosystem productivity set in motion by the rise in carbon dioxide levels\.236

These risks are compounded by strong pressures to increase efficiency through powerful economies of scale in food production, concentrating global food production in only a few breadbaskets\. The ho\- mogenization of food consumption habits leaves the world reliant for nourishment on a limited number of crops from a limited number of places\.237 So, behav\- ioural and social choices—diet choices and economic incentives to concentrate production—make us in\- creasingly vulnerable to synchronized crop failures\.238 Furthermore, the loss of crop diversity could desta\- bilize entire ecosystems and have adverse economic and social impacts\.239

Conflict weaves in additional layers of uncertain\- ty to the increasingly concentrated and homogenous global food production\. Consider the war in Ukraine, one of the world’s largest wheat producers and ex\- porters\. The Russian Federation controls much of the global market share of fertilizer—a key input in agri\- cultural production\. The conflict has disrupted grain and fertilizer exports, contributing to a commodity price shock, especially among people living in pover\- ty\.240 Beyond the battle\-related deaths and displace\- ments, energy insecurity is looming, a food insecurity

<a id="_bookmark40"></a>crisis is under way and geopolitical instability is on the rise\.241 Indeed, war may be a “trigger of triggers,” with global ripple effects\.

The Covid\-19 pandemic brought together zoonot\- ic disease, inequalities and global socioecological connectivity\. Unequal labour market conditions im\- plied that some workers could quickly transition to remote working arrangements, safeguarding health and economic livelihoods, but others had to continue interacting with people or leave their jobs\. And while social protection may have determined whether a person had the possibility of forgoing work to follow public health recommendations, political polariza\- tion, misinformation and deteriorating trust in sci\- ence and institutions were also at play, influencing whether people were willing to follow the recommen\- dations of public health authorities\.242

What the future may hold due to pandemics is a major source of distress,243 and the Covid\-19 pan\- demic may leave deep scars\. Inequality in access to digital technologies may have widened education disparities, setting back children in lower\-income countries\.244 While higher\-income countries could mobilize massive resources for recovery spend\- ing, often by borrowing at record\-low interest rates, lower\-income countries faced tight fiscal conditions and had to service debt rather than support people in dealing with the pandemic’s socioeconomic impacts\. Going forward, the differences in recovery spending between developed and developing economies may exacerbate differences in growth trajectories\.245

Zoonotic diseases and pandemics may be in the limelight, but health threats from anthropogenic im\- pacts on the planet expand beyond that\. Accelerat\- ed biodiversity loss is a threat to food security, since much of our agricultural production depends on pol\- linators\.246 Food security is a looming global crisis, with 2\.4 billion people facing moderate to severe food insecurity in 2020\. The loss of pollinators also affects the diversity and availability of different nutrients\.247 The loss of biodiversity reduces the potential for new medical discoveries and poses a direct threat to local and traditional medicinal practices\.248 Pollution is be\- coming a major health threat, causing approximately 9 million premature deaths globally in 2015, 92 per\- cent of them in low\- and middle\-income countries\.249 Exposure to air pollution has also been linked to high\- er Covid\-19 mortality\.250

A mismatch between interacting uncertainties and resilience strategies

The interaction of uncertainties casts doubt on the ef\- fectiveness of some of the resilience strategies that have historically been pursued \(see spotlight 1\.1\)\. Leveraging trade to cope with local climate extremes affecting food production, building temperature\-in\- different energy systems or migrating may be difficult amid layered and interacting uncertainties\. Where do we migrate if the entire world is affected by si\- multaneous natural hazards— or when inequalities and political polarization set up barriers to people’s movement? Can we diversify food supplies through imports in a world where increasing temperatures heighten the risk of simultaneous failures of wheat, maize and soybean harvests251 or where pandemic\-in\- duced labour shortages, war and geopolitical ten\- sions weaken global supply chains?252

The interaction of uncertainties casts doubt on the effectiveness of some of the resilience strategies that have historically been pursued\. Where do we migrate if the

“

entire world is affected by natural hazards—or when inequalities and political polarization set up barriers to people’s movement?

Our common aspirations, as codified in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Uni\- versal Declaration of Human Rights, are indivisible\. Today, many people are losing faith in our collective ability to meet them\.253 Indeed, democratic practices have been weakening,254 and the inability of coun\- tries to come together quickly enough during the Covid\-19 crisis to provide equitable vaccine access, another illustration\.255 UN Secretary\-General Antó\- nio Guterres has warned repeatedly of a fraying glob\- al world order256 and has called on nations to rebuild global solidarity and multilateral cooperation in the face of systemic and interconnected threats\.257

To meet the “confluence of calamities”258 in the world today, we need more international cooper\- ation, not less, and more solidarity across people, across generations and with the planet\. A main chal\- lenge to overcome is that action to ease planetary pressures is needed now, but some of the benefits will not materialize until well in the future\. Insights from

<a id="_bookmark41"></a>indigenous philosophies bridge these intergenera\- tional gaps and may contribute to foster change\. In many of these philosophies, past, present and future generations share “interwoven histories that shape \[…\] collective lives and the world” and intergenera\- tional responsibilities of “socioenvironmental guardi\- anship” are implied\.259 Restoring our connection with the planet and with ourselves, including across gen\- erations, and acting in ways that enhance our shared, intergenerational, collective lives then become central objectives\. Yet these perspectives are often marginalized in mainstream policy debates, mak\- ing the empowerment of indigenous and other mar\- ginalized communities not only a matter of justice but also a matter of gaining insights and ideas that could benefit humanity as a whole \(spotlight 1\.8\)\.260 Where we go from here is up to us: will we act

in time to avoid the worst consequences, or will

polarization drive disagreement and hinder change? Will we address the power imbalances and inequal\- ities that drive planetary pressures and obstruct people’s agency? Will the actions taken be enough, and will they benefit everyone, or will they exac\- erbate inequalities, adding strain to already weak\- ened social contracts and global cooperation? The uncertainty complex we face may seem daunting, but history provides ample evidence of individual and societal resilience\. Inaction in the face of deep uncertainty and compounding threats to human development is not an option\. Going forward, we need to be courageous enough to challenge the sta\- tus quo and to look into new places, new people and a diverse set of knowledge traditions for inspi\- ration and solutions\.261 Indeed, human agency can be a major driver of large\-scale societal change \(see chapter 3\)\.

##### Beyond crisis and collapse: Climate change in human history

__Dagomar Degroot, __*Georgetown University*

Today’s climate crisis has no precedent in Earth’s history, owing to the combination of its speed, even\- tual magnitude, global scale and human cause\. Yet regional and even global climates have changed profoundly and often abruptly over the roughly 300,000\-year history of humanity\.1 Anthropologists, archaeologists, economists, geneticists, geographers, historians, linguists and paleo scientists have long attempted to identify how these changes influenced communities and societies\. Scholars in this field— recently termed the history of climate and society \(HCS\)—typically identify relationships between cli\- matic and human histories not only to improve un\- derstandings of the past but also to inform forecasts of the hotter future\.2

For over a century the most influential studies in HCS argued that temperature and precipitation trends and anomalies caused human populations to either collapse or undergo subsistence crises\. While HCS scholars have not settled on a common, cross\-dis\- ciplinary definition of collapse, to them the concept usually involves a disintegration of socioeconomic complexity, leading to depopulation, new political structures and new settlement patterns\. HCS scholars have used statistical and qualitative methods to link drought and cooling to the collapse of, for example:

- The Akkadian Empire in the 3rd millennium BCE\.
- The societies of the Bronze Age Mediterranean in the 2nd millennium BCE\.
- The Western Roman Empire in the 5th and 6th centuries CE\.
- The cities of the Classical Maya in the 10th century CE\.
- Angkor, capital of the Khmer Empire, in the 15th century CE\.
- The Norse settlements of western Greenland in the 15th century CE\.3

When examining well\-documented and often comparatively recent periods and places, HCS schol\- ars usually concentrate on subsistence crises that

culminated in political transformation but not col\- lapse\. In such studies crises typically afflicted only one state—for example, during dynastic transitions in ancient Egypt or Imperial China—but occasionally also entire continents, in western Eurasia during the 14th or 17th century, for instance\. In this scholarship the worst\-affected civilizations were those with sub\- sistence strategies, hydraulic infrastructure, military and demographic pressures, or inefficient and unpop\- ular governments that left them vulnerable to envi\- ronmental disruption\.4

HCS studies of collapse and crisis inform common fears that present\-day civilizations cannot survive continued global warming\.5 Today’s climate change will indeed reduce agricultural productivity; limit the availability of freshwater; increase the severity of droughts, heat waves and tropical cyclones; and re\- shape coastal environments on a speed and scale that could provoke destabilizing societal responses\.6 Yet the disproportionate emphasis on collapse and crisis in HCS scholarship partly reflects systematic biases in how studies in the field are designed, rather than the most common historical responses to climate change\.7 HCS scholars are increasingly exploring the re\- silience of past populations to climatic changes and anomalies\. Definitions of resilience in climate\-related fields long privileged “bouncing back” in the wake of disaster and were eventually criticized for assuming that social change is inherently undesirable\. Critics argued moreover that the concept distracted from the more urgent priority of mitigating human green\- house gas emissions\. They claimed that focusing on resilience encouraged the assumption that disasters are inevitable—naturalizing sources of vulnerability in marginalized populations—and that it displaced re\- sponsibility for avoiding disaster from governments

to individuals\.8

Yet people of the past plainly found ways to cope with climate changes, and there is no term as accessi\- ble as resilience to describe their achievements\. Nor

is there any doubt that governments must foster re\- silience to the human\-caused warming that is already baked into the current climate crisis\. Today, the Inter\- governmental Panel on Climate Change \(IPCC\) uses the term resilience to mean the ability of coupled human and natural systems “to cope with a hazardous event or trend or disturbance, responding or reorgan\- izing in ways that maintain their essential function, identity and structure\.”9 It therefore encompasses adaptation, which the IPCC defines as the “process of adjustment to actual or expected climate and its ef\- fects, in order to moderate harm or exploit beneficial opportunities\.”10 Neither adaptation nor resilience is automatically a positive quality\. Both may preserve unjust systems and come at the expense of vulnerable populations\. In particular, the resilience of a society, government, institution or culture across decades or centuries may belie the vulnerability of ordinary peo\- ple to extreme weather\.11

Scholars in different disciplines have attempted to identify historical examples of resilience in diverse ways\. Archaeologists, for example, have perhaps overstressed “adaptionist” understandings of past responses to climate change\. Many have defined re\- silience using resilience theory, a method based on the adaptive cycle model, in which social\-ecological systems gradually lose resilience as they grow in size and complexity, then regain it after they collapse\. Yet today there is widespread disagreement over how—and whether—to use resilience theory\. Inter\- disciplinary collaborations therefore typically use broad conceptualizations of resilience, most of which roughly align with the IPCC’s definition\.12

One recent approach is to identify common path\- ways followed by populations that were broadly re\- silient in the face of past climate changes—meaning that they avoided serious or sustained demographic loss\. This approach can emphasize both the diversi\- ty of resilient responses to past climate changes and the existence of shared strategies that may inform present\-day climate policy\.13 There are at least five of these pathways \(figure S1\.1\.1\):

- Identifying new opportunities in local and regional environments\.
- Maintaining or developing resilient energy systems\.
- Exploiting diverse resources through trade\.
- Adapting institutions to new climatic risks\.
- Migrating to new environments\.

Populations that followed the first pathway ex\- ploited regional or local environments that respond\- ed to global or hemispheric climate changes in ways that benefitted how these populations had organ\- ized their societies\. The most striking examples date back to the Pleistocene, the geological epoch in which cycles in Earth’s orbit and rotation repeat\- edly altered greenhouse gas concentrations enough to trigger alternating glacial and interglacial peri\- ods\. In glacial periods advancing ice sheets trapped water previously in the oceans, lowering sea levels and creating land bridges that humans exploited to migrate across the Earth\. The same forces responsi\- ble for glacial and interglacial periods also strength\- ened monsoon systems, periodically “greening” the Sahara and helping pastoralists migrate through and thrive in what is now the world’s largest desert\. Pas\- toralists, in turn, may have delayed the redesertifi\- cation of parts of the Sahara by sustaining healthy grassland ecosystems\.14

Well into the Holocene, the recent geological epoch characterized by a relatively stable intergla\- cial climate, similar dynamics played out across smaller scales in time and space\. In the Eastern Med\- iterranean precipitation increased during winter, the region’s wet season, during the 6th century CE\. Pas\- toral and agricultural communities benefitted from higher rainfall because the taxation system of the Eastern Mediterranean allowed them to easily trans\- port agricultural commodities to population centres\. Rising productivity encouraged elites to invest in market\-oriented agriculture; new dams, channels, pools and other infrastructure then allowed farmers to manage water more effectively\.15

The second pathway involved developing or ex\- ploiting energy systems for transportation, industry and human subsistence that did not respond directly to shifts in temperature or precipitation\. As Europe\- an temperatures declined in the 6th century, com\- munities in Frisia \(in today’s northern Netherlands\) thrived by consuming dairy and meat from livestock, supplemented by fish, shellfish and waterfowl\. This subsistence strategy was less sensitive to cooling than others in Europe, many of which depended on culti\- vating grains that were sensitive to variations in tem\- perature\.16 In the same century subsistence strategies across much of Finland and in northern Sweden and Norway did not depend on crop cultivation and in

fact primarily exploited wild food resources such as birds, freshwater fish, seals and terrestrial mammals\. Changes in temperature affected the availability and accessibility of these resources in diverse ways\.17

In Kraków, Poland, firewood prices rose as win\- ter temperatures declined in the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries\. Because the city occupied an increasingly peripheral position within larger polities, state au\- thorities did not act to relieve high fuel prices\. The city’s inhabitants therefore shifted decisively from wood to coal for heating\. Coal was more reliable and less expensive than firewood—and therefore benefi\- cial for household budgets\.18

To follow the third pathway, populations exploited the benefits of trade—including trade within imperial borders—to cope with climate change\. Weather rarely affected far\-flung regions simultaneously or equally\. Trade therefore allowed populations to thrive despite climatic anomalies by importing commodities that were less available locally, owing in part to extreme weather\. The integration of European and then glob\- al grain markets in the 2nd millennium CE eventually buffered populations at the centre of trading networks from increases in food prices that were influenced by precipitation or temperature anomalies\.19 At the same time these networks could render populations on

their periphery more vulnerable to extreme weather\. In the late 19th century millions died when econom\- ic and political priorities led British governments to demand grain exports from colonized India, despite local droughts\.20

Some populations coped with climatic variability and change by inventing technologies and exploit\- ing commodities that opened new possibilities for trade\. When droughts and periods of high precipi\- tation alternated in southeastern California in the 15th century, Mojava settlements developed new ce\- ramic technologies and basket\-making techniques to establish trade networks centred on maize, beans and squash produced by nearby Kwatsáan communi\- ties\.21 These networks fostered the expansion of a dy\- namic “dream culture” that further elevated Mojave long\-distance trading\. Dreams that successfully di\- rected Mojaves towards prosperity or military victory rewarded leaders with political power, while dreams that resulted in failure undermined the individual leaders who shared them\. The result was a more mo\- bile, seasonally oriented and interregional economy that could better cope with climatic variability\.22

The fourth pathway involved deliberate political and institutional adaptations that fostered resilience to weather extremes\. Italian city\-states responded to agricultural disruptions worsened by 13th century cooling by securing new food imports, setting restric\- tions on grain prices, providing grain subsidies and banning grain exports\. Cooling across Europe in the final decades of the 17th century reduced grain yields and tax revenues across France just as grain supplies were already strained by military provisions\. French administrators struggled to respond effectively, and harvest failures in 1693 and 1694 led to catastroph\- ic famines\.23 When similar conditions returned in 1709, however, administrators negotiated emergency grain imports from Algeria that effectively eased food shortages\.24

Finally, populations took the fifth pathway by mi\- grating to either escape or exploit the impacts of cli\- mate change in local environments\. Climate refugees migrating to escape the desertification of the east\- ern Sahara likely helped establish Pharaonic Egypt\.25 Across Eurasia, pastoral societies later threatened agrarian empires when precipitation changes ei\- ther allowed them to rear more horses or threatened grasslands that otherwise sustained them\. Some

migrations by pastoralists responded to subsistence crises—and thus political and military vulnerability— within agrarian empires\. Jurchen raids, for instance, exploited destabilizing droughts in 17th century China to establish the Qing Dynasty\.26

Populations often pursued multiple pathways at the same time, and different communities in soci\- eties could follow distinct pathways\. Populations may also have benefitted from additional pathways to endure or exploit climate changes\. For example, resilient populations may have enjoyed low socio\- economic inequality or effective means of providing life’s necessities for their poorest members\. A robust culture of civic charity in Dutch coastal cities helped insulate the 16th and 17th century Dutch Repub\- lic from famines that affected primarily poor people in other parts of Europe\.27 Similarly, the population of Tokugawa Japan soared during periods of severe 17th century cooling partly because wealthy farm\- ers were expected to provide for poor people\.28 Ad\- ditional pathways may have been adaptive for some communities but maladaptive for others\. Capital\-in\- tensive hydraulic infrastructure likely increased the vulnerability to drought of polities in South America, Egypt, Mesopotamia and Cambodia, all of which de\- pended on canals for irrigation, but provided drain\- age and transportation opportunities in coastal areas of the present\-day Netherlands and thereby stimu\- lated the development of greater wealth and military potential\.29

What, then, can policymakers learn from the di\- verse experiences of climate change in the past to build resilience to today’s human\-caused warming? One lesson may be that the impacts of climate change on populations were and are determined as much by human socioeconomic, cultural and political arrange\- ments as the magnitude of environmental transfor\- mations\. Communities, therefore, are rarely doomed to a particular fate; under all but the most extreme emissions scenarios, substantial scope remains for human adaptation and prosperity\.

More specifically, the past reveals that adaptations to build resilience may involve identifying and ex\- ploiting what rare opportunities warming may pro\- vide, developing energy systems that both mitigate emissions and are resilient to extreme weather, diver\- sifying sources of energy and commodities, restoring or maintaining flexible political and legal systems

that prioritize redundancies over efficiencies and nor\- malizing climate migration\. The past may also reveal that tackling inequality and poverty—in particular, through policies that further environmental justice for historically marginalized populations—will foster resilience to global warming\. And it may indicate that

capital\-intensive interventions to adapt to climate change have the potential to become sources of vul\- nerability\. More HCS scholarship will further clarify the lessons of the past, lessons that may offer compel\- ling reasons for hope and suggest strategies for sus\- tainable human development in the decades to come\.

##### The nuclear–environment nexus and human development in the Anthropocene

__Rens van Munster, __*Danish Institute for International Studies, *and __Casper Sylvest, __*University of Southern Denmark, Department of History*

When Paul Crutzen and Eugene Stoermer coined the term Anthropocene in 2000 to denote an epoch characterized by the geological impact of the human species on planet Earth, these effects were already evident\.1 Since then, geologists and other scientists have debated the starting point of the Anthropo\- cene\. Among the contenders is the dispersion of ra\- dioactive isotopes from widespread nuclear testing during the 1950s—an indicator also singled out by the Anthropocene Working Group under the Inter\- national Commission on Stratigraphy\.2 Meanwhile, the Anthropocene has become both a ubiquitous scientific concept and a potent political symbol that extends to the Earth’s climate and ecosystems\. As a result, questions of extinction and survival loom large in political debates about human development in this new epoch\. Such debates echo those around the Cold War nuclear arms race, and there are good reasons for scrutinizing the intellectual and political links between the nuclear age and the current predic\- ament\. Indeed, a closer examination of the nuclear– environment nexus offers a prescient perspective on the persistent links between militarization and an\- thropogenic reconfigurations of the planet\.

Historically, the connections between nuclear weapons and the environment are both multiple and deep\. That nature could be controlled and manipulat\- ed was an integral part of the notion of security dur\- ing the Cold War\. The postwar development of such scientific disciplines as meteorology, glaciology and oceanography took place in a close relationship with the preparations for nuclear war, since adequate un\- derstanding of the effects of these weapons—vital for strategy and defence— depended on ecologi\- cal knowledge\. Over time these branches of science produced a new understanding of the Earth and its interacting systems, which in turn fostered concep\- tions of security as common and tied to the natural environment\.

Nuclear testing and uncertainties about the effects of radioactive fallout gave rise to scientific measure\- ments and environmental concerns, entanglements that persist to this day in climate modelling\.3 Anti\- nuclear activists and movements unrelentingly criti\- cized the arms race and the attendant risks of nuclear deterrence while exploiting scientific uncertainty and disagreement to expand political responsibility in time and space\. Temporally, the effects of nucle\- ar weapons revolved around future generations\. And spatially, the effects transgressed any ground zero and came to include concern for both humanity and the planet, later symbolized in iconic photos of a liv\- ing yet fragile Earth taken from space\. The nuclear arms race paradoxically sparked a more ecocentric conception of the environment\.4

The 1980s, when détente had given way to the second Cold War, witnessed an intensification and emerging synthesis of such links, especially striking in the work of Jonathan Schell, author of the best\- selling *The Fate of the Earth *\(1982\)\.5 The book, which compels people to imagine the extinction of the human species as a way of cultivating a global eco\- logical awareness that included the fate of future gen\- erations, played a central role in the “nuclear freeze” movement and primed the public for debates about nuclear winter\. Drawing on the latest insights from Earth system science, Schell concluded that the en\- vironmental effects of nuclear war would most likely leave Earth uninhabitable for humans\. The political lesson taught by science was clear: the survival of the human species depended on functioning Earth systems and had to be seen in a broader ecological framework\. To Schell, nuclear weapons symbolized not only modernity’s inability to recognize its own self\-destructiveness but also a hubris in humans’ belief that the threat to complex, fragile and highly interdependent ecosystems could be rationally man\- aged and contained\.6

After the turn of the millennium, Schell’s under\- standing of the entanglements between nuclear weapons and climate issues led him to recognize the value of the Anthropocene as an idea that explicitly foregrounds the connections between Western mo\- dernity and human technological prowess on the one hand and climate change, species extinction and biodiversity loss on the other\. To Schell the Anthro\- pocene called for reflecting more deeply on human– Earth relations and expanding the conventional horizons of space, time, community and agency\. Yet, valuing ourselves as humans in relation to nature and other forms of life involves a heavy ethical and po\- litical responsibility, and Schell clearly feared that humans were not up to the task at a time when their technological power forcefully set the species apart from the rest of creation\. Ultimately, however, Schell insisted on the role of human beings as “chief valuer” and maintained that a true embrace of this responsi\- bility would decentre the human, whether by install\- ing sober lessons about humility, prudence and the limits of a narrow technological rationality or by pro\- moting more ecocentric valuations of the world, as

expressed in ideas about interspecies entanglements, companionship and “nature\-based” solutions to cli\- mate change\.7

Schell’s work is a reminder of the deep relation\- ship between nuclear weapons and the environment in the Anthropocene\. Nuclear weapons are detri\- mental to human development and risk jeopardiz\- ing the ecological systems on which it depends\. The vast economic resources required for the produc\- tion, maintenance and stockpiling of nuclear weap\- ons divert funds away from human development and achieving the Sustainable Development Goals\. Nuclear war would also have grave humanitarian consequences, including large\-scale displacements, long\-term harm to human health, restricted access to food and catastrophic damage to the environment\. Some scientists predict that even a limited nuclear war could set off a global nuclear winter\.8 In a nucle\- ar\-armed world survivability and sustainability are tightly entwined\.

##### What kind of institution is needed for existential security?

__Toby Ord, __*Senior Research Fellow, The Future of Humanity Institute, University of Oxford, United Kingdom*

Humanity has faced many natural existential risks over the 3,000 centuries we have survived so far— such as risks from asteroid impacts or supervolcanic eruptions\. But the anthropogenic risks we now face appear much greater in probability and continue to rise as our power over the world grows ever greater\.1 It is unclear whether we can survive another three centuries, let alone three thousand\.

To survive, we need to achieve two things\. We must first bring the current level of existential risk down— putting out the fires we already face from the threat of nuclear war and climate change\. But we cannot al\- ways be fighting fires\. A defining feature of existen\- tial risk is that there are no second chances—a single existential catastrophe would be our permanent un\- doing\. So we must also create the equivalent of fire brigades and fire\-safety codes—making institutional changes to ensure that existential risk \(including that from new technologies and developments\) stays low forever\.

If we can achieve both these things, we will have reached existential security: a return to comparative safety, where we have ended the era of heightened risk to humanity\.2 This would be no utopia\. Existen\- tial security would not guarantee universal human development or freedom— or health and prosperi\- ty\. But it would be necessary to achieve any of those things—a foundation on which they rest\.

One way to look at our current position is that hu\- manity faces a high and unsustainable level of risk\. Indeed, we can see this as one of the most fundamen\- tal kinds of sustainability\. Think of the probability that humanity will continue to survive and flourish over a time span comparable with the 3,000 centu\- ries we have lived so far\. Each year that our time of heightened risk goes on, this probability of a success\- ful future drops\. And nothing we ever do could restore that chance\. The probability of humanity surviving to live out its potential is the ultimate nonrenewable re\- source: something we depend on completely—with

no possible substitutes—but are frittering away\. Exis\- tential security means stabilizing humanity’s survival curve—greatly reducing the risk and ensuring that it stays low\. Only by doing so can we keep the probabili\- ty of long\-term survival high \(figure S1\.3\.1\)\.

What would be required to stem this loss—to reach existential security?

A large part of the answer has to come from inter\- national institutions\. Existential security is inher\- ently international: the risks that could destroy us transcend national boundaries, and finding ways forward that never once succumb to an existential catastrophe will require international coordination\. Meeting this challenge would be an extremely diffi\- cult but necessary task\. Here are some broad outlines of what it would require\.

As Carl Sagan wrote: “The world\-altering powers that technology has delivered into our hands now re\- quire a degree of consideration and foresight that has never before been asked of us\.”3 We need the fore\- sight to see the risks while they are still on the hori\- zon, providing time to steer around them or, if that is impossible, to prepare to meet them\. This involves knowing how to ask the right questions about future dangers\. And while being able to accurately answer such questions is impossible, great progress is being made in systematically assigning well\-calibrated and accurate probabilities to them\.4 An institution aimed at existential security would need to harness this pro\- gress and be at the forefront of forecasting expertise\. It would also require extremely high trust: from both the public and the elites across many different nation states\. Perhaps it could learn from the Inter\- governmental Panel on Climate Change, with its attempts to neutrally establish the current state of scientific consensus on climate change in a transpar\-

ent manner, with input from all nations\.

An institution for existential security would need extremely strong coordinating ability\. Because exis\- tential risk threatens a common foundation on which

all of our varied hopes and futures are built, it is in every nation’s interest to avoid it\. But because differ\- ent strategies and tactics for avoiding risk will have burdens that fall unevenly upon the nations, there are still great challenges for coordinating a path forward that everyone can accept\.

Finally, such an institution would require a great deal of buy\-in\. This would have to be both strong and lasting\.

Strong buy\-in would be required before the idea of an institution to govern existential risks could even get off the ground, as nations will not lightly make the sacrifices in sovereignty that would be required\. While there is not sufficient buy\-in at the moment, this may change over years or decades as people slowly face up to the gravity of the threats facing hu\- manity\. And just as the United Nations was formed in the wake of the crisis and catastrophe of the Sec\- ond World War, in the wake of new global crises and

threats, the idea of new institutions with the power to achieve existential security may move quickly from unthinkable to inevitable\.

Our resolve would have to be lasting\. National constitutions provide proof that building institution\- al constraints that last hundreds of years is possible\. Designing a constitution means setting in place the parameters for our descendants to operate across generations—as well as the means to adjust those parameters if circumstances change in unforeseen ways\. Building institutions to reach existential secu\- rity would have much in common with formulating a constitution—not just for a nation, but for humanity, and with a focus on ensuring that each generation co\- operates to give succeeding generations the chance the exist and flourish in their turn\.

##### People–planet relationships in an uncertain, unsettled world

__Belinda Reyers, __*University of Pretoria and Beijer Institute of Ecological Economics of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences*

People–planet interactions underpin many of the di\- verse capacities required to embrace uncertainty, to navigate and respond to the complex dynamics of the Anthropocene\. The diversity of life on Earth and all the myriad functions, connections and interactions we have with it provides short\-term and long\-term ca\- pacity for life \(including human life\) to persist under and adapt to sudden and gradual changes of the An\- thropocene\. As dominant models of development— with their emphasis on industrialization, resource exploitation and urbanization— continue to erode biodiversity and human interactions with it, we lose options and opportunities, reducing flexibili\- ty and adaptive capacity\. Worryingly, these declines further push other planetary pressures such as cli\- mate change and pollution ever closer to dangerous thresholds\.1

A focus on human–nature relationships and trans\- formative capacities moves away from the risk reduc\- tion approaches that have become dominant as ways to manage uncertainty but that often fail to address the complex causes of planetary pressures and ine\- quality\.2 Instead, by foregrounding on relationships, policy can overcome problematic divisions between nature and development to focus on the quality of relationships connecting people and planet and on reconfiguring relationships to enhance capacities to navigate uncertain futures\.3 For example, new indica\- tors emerging from indigenous community monitor\- ing systems feature relationships connecting people and nature, such as indicators of the condition of the human–biodiversity relationship4 and indicators that monitor relationships and feedbacks between the social and ecological components of a place\.5 Such monitoring systems do not treat the social and ecological parts as separable\. They focus instead on what connects them and could prove a valuable way forward for more integrated approaches to assessing human development progress\.

Recognizing people–planet relationships widens the focus of policy from the local level to take into ac\- count the globally intertwined social\-ecological sys\- tems of the Anthropocene\. An increase in planetary pressures in one part of the world ripples across re\- gions, with material and other less tangible impacts on distant places and groups, as the Covid\-19 pan\- demic has so graphically highlighted\. The Anthro\- pocene is a heightened state of interconnectedness where social\-ecological teleconnections and power asymmetries in global systems require new forms of solidarity for the interdependencies and realities of the Anthropocene\.6 Transitions in one country from nonrenewable energy sources \(fossil fuels\) towards renewable energy \(solar\)— done in solidarity with groups and places where the mineral resources \(co\- balt or lithium\) for these technologies reside—will likely have very different outcomes for human devel\- opment from local transitions that do not account for such distant impacts and dynamics\.7

Inclusion and participation, so central to the human development journey, can also have blind spots\. Fo\- cusing on people–planet relationships highlights ad\- ditional barriers and potentially new dimensions of inclusiveness\. It opens avenues to explore moral or ethical questions around including nonhuman enti\- ties and the risks and impacts imposed on those en\- tities through various policy choices\. This expansion of care and concern in human development is a lively topic receiving increasing attention as the intercon\- nection and impact of our relationship with the natu\- ral world becomes more apparent\.8 It is strengthened as development policy engages more deeply with multiple knowledge and value systems that reject the separation of human and nonhuman or of nature and people\.

Biocultural approaches, for example, portray human livelihoods, landscapes and ecosystems as having coevolved over long periods of time\.

Biocultural diversity is the “diversity of life in all its manifestations—biological, cultural, and linguistic

—which are interrelated within a complex socio\- ecological adaptive system\.”9

Taking into account the dynamics of the Anthropo\- cene, where complex social\-ecological interactions result in lag effects and where today’s choices are committing the planet to global\-scale changes that will span thousands of years,10 it becomes apparent that inclusion and participation have an important temporal dimension and that policy must innovate to include young people and consider future gener\- ations whose realities are being shaped for the long term by actions and choices taken today\.

Innovation and human development have long gone hand in hand\. In the context of the Anthropo\- cene, there is, however, a risk that many of the in\- novative policies, practices and interventions that exist and are emerging will all stay small, localized and short term—tinkering at the edges without fun\- damentally rewiring development models and ap\- proaches to truly contend with the Anthropocene, the scale of its planetary pressures and the economic and political systems and asymmetries on which it is based\.11 Innovations that do not consider what needs to be built up and broken down, what needs protec\- tion and how to manage power asymmetries and par\- ticipation can end up increasing vulnerability and eroding sustainability and resilience\.12

Substituting one innovation \(such as fossil fuel\) with another \(such as renewable energy\) without ad\- dressing justice and sustainability of the transition will reduce emissions but will also likely defer many

other impacts and risks to another place, group and time, without necessarily improving energy access and democracy\.13 As the 2020 Human Development Report made clear: “We must reorient our approach from solving discrete siloed problems to navigating multidimensional, interconnected and increasingly universal predicaments\.”14 By anchoring innovation in deliberate considerations of people–planet rela\- tionships, the interconnections and interdependen\- cies become clear and offer novel opportunities for human development in an uncertain future\.15 These interdependencies are not only material flows of en\- ergy, resources and waste; they are also intangible but essential in how they shape identities, cultures, relationships, minds, mental and physical wellbeing, and ultimately freedoms and choices in ways we often realize only when lost\.16

Without acknowledging these relationships in the human development journey, dangerous feedbacks and negative people–planet relationships will under\- mine human development gains\.17 Previous inno\- vations that have ignored these relationships to the detriment of the environment, vulnerable groups, local adaptive capacities and cultural practices are legion\.18 On the other hand, research exploring per\- sistent poverty traps that considers social\-ecological interactions highlights not only important causes of these traps but also novel pathways out of poverty\.19 As Michele\-Lee Moore and colleagues point out, it is “the capacity to see, interrogate, and reimagine” these people–planet relationships that will create the disruptive and radical changes needed for transfor\- mations to sustainability\.20

##### On economic insecurity

__Jonathan Perry, Marta Roig __*and *__Maren Jiménez, __*United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs*

Economic security is a cornerstone of wellbeing\. Eco\- nomic stability and some degree of predictability en\- able people to plan and invest in their future and that of their children\. They encourage innovation, rein\- force social connections and build trust in others and in institutions\.1 Worry and anxiety about the future have negative health outcomes, ranging from mental health problems to heart disease and increased risk of obesity, including among children\.2 Pervasive eco\- nomic insecurity generates popular discontent and imperils political stability\.

Even before the Covid\-19 pandemic, many peo\- ple found themselves and their families on shaky economic ground\. Growing employment instability and work that is increasingly precarious and poorly paid, together with persistent joblessness, are root causes of rising economic insecurity in high\-income countries\. In low\- and middle\-income countries high informal employment continues to affect income stability\. People can no longer rely on stable, decent work to provide economic stability throughout their lives—a trend compounded by the Covid\-19 pandem\- ic and an emerging climate crisis\.

Increased awareness of climate change and its many implications has injected growing uncertainty about the future and raised people’s concerns about their wellbeing in the long run\. Even though the ef\- fects are shaping anxieties worldwide, the impacts will be uneven\. People in the poorest countries, par\- ticularly children and young people, stand to lose the most\.

Indeed, people in poverty are more exposed to ad\- verse events, from ill health to the growing impacts of systemic shocks such as climate change and pan\- demics, and have fewer resources to cope with and recover from their consequences\. However, many people who are not poor by national or international standards are or feel economically insecure as well\. In fact, while economic security and confidence in the future have traditionally been defining features

of the middle class, this group is feeling increasing\- ly insecure\.3 Workers in the informal economy and the growing number of people under nonstandard contractual arrangements are highly insecure, as are people with lower education levels, women, younger adults, members of racial and ethnic minorities and heads of single\-parent households\.4

Despite its significance, growing economic in\- security has stayed under the policy radar in many countries\. Experts find fault in the fact that it is not adequately reflected in standard national statistics\.5 Indeed, many measurement issues related to inse\- curity are still unresolved, and empirical research on developing countries is scarce\.

Whatever the method used to assess economic risks, the implications of these risks depend crucial\- ly on the buffers available\. Catastrophic expenses and large debts drive falls into poverty when social protection systems do not help guard against risks or cover their effects\. Even in developed countries with comprehensive social protection systems, compara\- tive cross\-country data suggest that public transfers protect only about 40 percent of adults against large drops in disposable income \(drops of 25 percent of disposable income or above\)\.6

Not only are risks growing, but policies are also not keeping up with current trends\. Public institu\- tions, policies and governance systems are struggling to adapt to rapidly changing needs across countries\. Social protection coverage is often contingent on a traditional formal employer–employee relationship, and many schemes are not portable across jobs\. La\- bour market institutions and regulations are also challenged by the growing diversification of working arrangements\.

There are, however, policy innovations in both de\- veloped and developing countries that demonstrate the capacity of social protection systems, labour market institutions and public services to adapt to changing circumstances\. These include new forms

of social protection that adequately cover informal workers, migrant workers or those with nonstandard contracts\.7 There are also agile programmes that au\- tomatically scale up in response to systemic shocks, such as pandemics or climate\-related emergencies\. Some groups of informal workers have pursued new models of collective representation to protect their interests, namely through cooperatives, self\- help groups and associations\. Some of these new organizations have helped workers connect and un\- dertake collective action, but many lack the legal capacity to negotiate working conditions\. A key challenge for these organizations is that many in\- formal workers are not considered workers under the law and therefore do not have bargaining rights\. In some countries—Canada, Germany and Swe\- den, for instance— collective bargaining rights have been extended to some categories of self\-employed workers\.8

Providing economic security remains a key role of the state and its institutions and is a foundation of the social contract between government and citi\- zens\. Many governments spend a substantial share of GDP to safeguard against hardship\-causing loss\- es, through social protection systems, healthcare and other public services\. This is a crucial moment to re\- flect on how to adapt past policies and institutions to a new socioeconomic reality\.

Large\-scale crises heighten risk and insecurity and have, at times, opened a path to renew the social con\- tract\. The unprecedented income support and health measures put in place by many governments as a re\- sponse to the Covid\-19 pandemic attest to the prima\- ry role that the state continues to play in confronting economic risk and insecurity\. Policy responses to the crisis have ranged from direct payroll support to employers to covering income losses in informal

employment to rent payments and eviction moratori\- ums, not to mention expanding healthcare coverage in traditionally underserved areas\.9

However, many of these measures are temporary\. Most of them leave beneficiaries just as vulnerable to future shocks once they are removed\. Compre\- hensive, universal social protection systems, when in place, play a much more durable role in protecting workers and in reducing the prevalence of poverty than short\-term, ad hoc measures, since they act as automatic stabilizers\. They provide basic income se\- curity at all times and therefore enhance people’s ca\- pacity to manage and overcome shocks\.

Countries with social protection systems already in place were able to scale them up quickly during the Covid\-19 pandemic\. Investments in building and expanding social protection systems in some Latin American countries over the past decades have cush\- ioned the fallout from the crisis, at least in the short term\.10 Many other low\- and middle\-income coun\- tries entered the crisis on weak financial footing, however\. Their ability to expand social protection has been constrained by lack of fiscal space as well as by a lack of existing mechanisms on which to build\. Overall, the financial support to individuals and fam\- ilies has varied dramatically across countries, as has access to vaccines and thus the speed of econom\- ic recovery\. Without urgent corrective action from the international community, the current crisis is likely to widen disparities both within and between countries\.11

Focusing on the challenges people face today— from increasingly precarious employment to inad\- equate healthcare and difficulty accessing social protection, housing and other public services— can narrow social, economic and political divides and guard against the next global crisis\.

##### Building an environment of peace in a new era of risk

__Environment of Peace Initiative, __*Stockholm International Peace Research Institute*

Humanity has entered a new era of risk created by the confluence of twin crises— one rooted in the darkening global security horizon, the other stem\- ming from ongoing environmental destruction\. The risks are complex and often unpredictable\. While failing to address either crisis adequately, govern\- ments are not paying enough attention to the cross\- over points where the most dangerous situations are emerging\.

There are more hungry and displaced people than a decade ago,1 twice as many state\-based conflicts and twice as many deaths in those conflicts\.2 Govern\- ments are spending more on their military forces\.3 Even before the war in Ukraine, nuclear states were increasing the number of warheads being held in readiness for use\.4 Meanwhile, the impacts of climate change are worsening,5 plastic pollution and resource depletion continue almost unabated and the health of ecosystems declines\.

Half a century ago, at the United Nations Con\- ference on the Human Environment in Stockholm, governments formally recognized that ecological integrity is essential to human development\.6 Now, the consequences of declining ecological integrity are clear\. The countries facing the greatest ecologi\- cal threat are statistically likely to be among the least peaceful\. They also tend to be marked by fragility and low capacity for resilience\.7 Half of ongoing UN peace operations are in the countries with the highest expo\- sure to climate change impacts\.8

A climate change impact or the disappearance of an important food resource does not axiomatical\- ly cause insecurity and conflict, but it does increase the risk\.9 The risk will be heightened if the society in question is already tense, fragile or insecure and will be lower if it is well\-governed and well\-resourced \(box S1\.6\.1\)\. Additionally, insecurity can lead to peo\- ple taking decisions that damage environmental integrity\.

To succeed, transitions must be just and peaceful

Turning back the tide of environmental decline is necessary in order to reduce the risks and secure an environment of peace\. It will entail major transitions in such sectors as energy, industry and land use\.10 Transitions need to occur quickly and successfully\. However, interventions aiming to tackle an environ\- mental problem can exacerbate insecurity or cause a different form of environmental damage\.

In the 2000s the rush to biofuels led to landgrabs in the Global South as producers looked to meet de\- mand stimulated by policy choices in the Global North\. This contributed to soaring food prices and resultant unrest in countries such as Burkina Faso, Egypt and Haiti\.11

Building hydropower dams has altogether dis\- placed an estimated 80 million people on every in\- habited continent\.12 In Myanmar dam building has forced displaced people into areas populated by other ethnic groups, leading to clashes\.13 Once in place, dams restrict water availability for downstream use, disrupt biodiversity and fish stocks important for food, flood farmland and divide communities\.

Meeting the Paris Agreement 1\.5°C target could entail a 10\-fold expansion of hydropower in Afri\- ca\.14 Governments and companies such as airlines propose increased biofuel production\.15 Unless a dif\- ferent approach is taken, conflict and displacement could result again\.

With the sixth mass extinction of species in Earth’s history possibly under way, attempts to protect na\- ture and biodiversity are at a crunch point\. More than 90 governments now support the goal of protecting 30 percent of the Earth’s surface through conserva\- tion by 2030, the so\-called 30×30 initiative,16 which is up for negotiation at the 2022 UN Convention on Bi\- ological Diversity summit\.17 However, with 300 mil\- lion people living in key biodiversity areas, 30×30 has

__Box S1\.6\.1 Haiti’s systemic shock__

*Environment of Peace Initiative, *Stockholm International Peace Research Institute

Haiti, the lowest income country in the Americas, has been beset by decades of political instability, natural hazards \(in\- cluding a massive earthquake in the Southern Peninsula of the country in 2010\) and removal of tree cover, in turn leav\- ing communities exposed to storms and landslides\.1 In January 2020 the Haitian Parliament dissolved after elections were postponed, with President Jovenel Moïse attempting to rule by decree against a backdrop of continuing public unrest\.2 Two months later Haiti reported its first cases of Covid\-19\. The government declared a health emergency, with a familiar mix of school and business closures, limitations on transport and gatherings, and a night\-time curfew\.3

With three\-fifths of the population already below the poverty line and antigovernment sentiment running high,4 people refused to abide by the regulations, boosting the infection rate\.5 Agricultural production fell, and food prices rose by more than 25 percent\.6 In August tropical storm Laura came to Haiti, ruining 50–80 percent of certain crops in the southeast\.7 Unusually dry months followed, depressing harvests by up to 80 percent\. Entering 2021, food prices were running 40 percent above normal\.8

In May 2021, with Covid\-19 cases soaring, the government redeclared a state of emergency\.9 In July tropical storm Elsa hit the same southeast regions devastated by Laura the previous year\.10 Four days later, for reasons that remain unclear, gunmen assassinated President Moïse, unleashing a further period of political turmoil\.11 Soon afterward, the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization declared that nearly half the Haitian population was in acute food insecurity\.12

Perhaps a country with stable politics could have coped with the two storms in quick succession\. Perhaps without the restrictions around Covid\-19, political order could have been restored\. But the combination of the previous de\- cades of environmental destruction and political turmoil, unrest in the streets, Covid\-19 and two major storms dealt Haiti a systemic blow\. Millions have been left without sufficient food or prospects, the only certainty being that more insecurity lies ahead\.

historically generated very little conflict\. However,		

there are potential issues at both ends of the product lifecycle, as there are with batteries for energy stor\- age and electric vehicles\. At the source end, concerns focus on the human rights abuses connected with some mining operations for minerals such as lithium, cobalt and rare earth elements\.20 At the disposal end, wind turbines, solar panels and batteries need to be made fully recyclable, to avoid the creation of poten\- tially huge waste streams\.21

The urgency of the crisis in nature and climate change is so acute that rapid and profound transitions are needed to halt and reverse it\. Failure to do so will inevitably lead to further security risks associated with continuously rising impacts\. However, failure to

Beginnings of a new security

Despite the gravity of the global situation, there are hopeful signs from community projects up to the su\- pranational institution level\.

Recognition within the United Nations of the rela\- tionship between environmental degradation and se\- curity dates back to at least January 1992, when the Security Council declared that “non\-military sources of instability in the economic, social, humanitarian and ecological fields have become threats to peace and security\.”22 The link has since been acknowl\- edged in many other declarations and initiatives, in\- cluding the Sustainable Development Goals and the

Sustaining Peace initiative\.23 Nevertheless, security and environmental agendas have largely progressed along separate tracks\. The creation of the Climate Se\- curity Mechanism in 2018 has built a bridge, but the serial vetoing of resolutions on climate change and security within the Security Council is one bar to full\- er coordination\.

Several regional blocs also acknowledge the links between environmental degradation and security, in\- cluding the African Union, the European Union, the Organisation for Security and Co\-operation in Eu\- rope and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations\. The African Union recognizes that addressing human impacts on the planet, such as climate change, will re\- duce the risk of conflict and commits to tackling them as a route to securing development\.24

At the operational level, the UN Assistance Mission in Somalia represents an important step forward\. It is the first mission to include a dedicated environmen\- tal and climate security adviser\.25 The United Nations is deploying similar advisers elsewhere\.

Civil society organizations and international agen\- cies have launched many initiatives that build peace and address environmental degradation simultane\- ously in historically conflict\-prone areas\. In the Sahel, where climate change impacts and overuse of water have exacerbated tension between pastoralists and farmers, multiple projects are improving resource management and animal health, facilitating access to markets, helping pastoralists diversify sources of income and managing conflict\.26 Across the borders of Israel, Jordan and the State of Palestine, the non\- governmental organization EcoPeace builds mutual understanding among communities whose security is impacted by shortfalls in water and energy access relating to environmental decline\.27 In Uganda the Strengthening Resilience and Inclusive Governance project aims to defuse tensions between refugees and host communities who would otherwise be compet\- ing for the same charcoal resources and in the pro\- cess would use it unsustainably\.28 All these examples can be learned from and scaled up\.

Towards an environment of peace

There are, broadly, two areas in which governments and other decisionmaking institutions need to take

action to mitigate the growing threat to peace posed by the twin crises\.

One is to link up responses to insecurity and envi\- ronmental degradation, at every level from policy\- making down to projects, so that manifestations of the crises are tackled holistically\. This cannot be only about responses to emerging situations—it must also be anticipatory, involving horizon scanning, forecast\- ing, knowledge sharing and resilience building\.

The second is to get on with solving the under\- lying environmental threats\. Security risks will keep growing until society rebuilds the natural resource base, restores biodiversity, aggressively limits pollu\- tion and reduces greenhouse gas emissions to net\-ze\- ro\. Moves to do this must be undertaken in a just and peaceful way—but they must be undertaken\.

The Stockholm International Peace Research In\- stitute report *Environment of Peace,*29 launched in May 2022, concludes with six recommendations for action and five principles to guide them\. The prin\- ciples include approaching the crises cooperative\- ly, because a nationalistic approach to threats faced in common is clearly illogical and inefficient\. Gov\- ernments need to combine far\-sighted vision and strategy with urgent action and to adapt strategies as they go along because the manifestations of the twin crises will evolve\. All the transitions needed to halt and reverse environmental degradation, in\- cluding climate change, must be enacted justly and peacefully—which also implies enacting them inclu\- sively, ensuring that affected people are involved in decisionmaking and share in the benefits\.

The recommendations themselves include some that will build resilience\. For example:

- All governments should carry out a risk assess\- ment on the security risks posed by environmental decline\.
- All transboundary resources such as river basins should be covered by resource\-sharing agree\- ments, and those agreements should be made fit for purpose in an era of climate change\.
- Early warning systems for conflict should include indicators of environmental change\.

Others address root causes\. For example:

- Governments should, as far and fast as possible, stop funding conflict risk through building up weaponry and subsidising fossil fuels and instead fund environmental restoration and peace\.
	- The public and private sectors should proactively identify and reduce conflict risks in the clean tech\- nology supply chain\.
	- Indigenous peoples and other marginalized groups should routinely be involved in making decisions that concern them\.

All the recommendations can be implemented within the next few years\. And all should be\. Gov\- ernments agreed, in approving the Working Group 2

report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in February 2022, that there is “a brief and rapidly closing window to secure a liveable and sus\- tainable future for all\.”30 The context of its words was climate change; but they are equally applicable across the entire risk landscape of the twin security and en\- vironmental crises\. With the escalating risks having been identified, it is clearly in every government’s self\-interest to act\.

##### Low\-carbon transformations: A green resource curse?

New low\-carbon technologies such as electric vehi\- cles and renewable energy generation will require much larger inputs of nonrenewable minerals than are needed for high\-carbon energy sources, such as petroleum\-powered cars\.1 In many instances these minerals are found in a very limited number of loca\- tions, often low\- and middle\-income countries\.2

Africa hosts some of the largest reserves of many of the minerals used to produce low\-carbon technol\- ogies at scale\.3 And by 2040 renewable energy is pro\- jected to account for 75 percent of Africa’s new power generation and 40 percent of its total power genera\- tion\.4 These two trends could boost economic growth and improve living standards\. But many resource\-rich countries have suffered from a “resource curse,” with resource wealth fuelling violent conflict, heightened poverty and social inequality\.5 The shift to low\-car\- bon technologies and renewable energy raises con\- cerns about potential “green resource curses\.”

There are multiple channels for low\-carbon tran\- sitions to lead to conflict and dispossession\. A recent mapping of renewable energy projects and conflict sites across five African countries revealed a sub\- stantial correlation\. Proximity to a renewable energy site was strongly associated with higher conflict risk across green activities, ranging from establishing re\- newable energy projects to green mineral mining to producing renewable energy\.6

Establishing and operating renewable energy pro\- jects are frequently fraught with tension over land acquisition, employment opportunities and benefit sharing—often compounded by a lack of consultation with existing landowners and users, especially where customary land users may lack written documenta\- tion of their claims\. Grievances were compounded by concerns about local employment opportunities and the lack of a mechanism for reinvesting project revenues in the local community\.7 Moreover, many residents in the communities closest to the project

sites were not afforded access to the national electric grid, despite ceding their historical lands for project development\.

Tensions often persist after projects become op\- erational\. Key reasons include limited employment opportunities and a perceived lack of benefit shar\- ing among the communities most impacted by such projects\. When the benefits and value produced from such projects are seen as benefitting far\-away elites or a rival status group, the potential for conflict is high\. This risk can be reduced by including local communi\- ties and indigenous and marginalized groups in pro\- ject planning\.

Green mineral mining is also a classic example of a potential resource curse\. From cobalt and coltan in the Democratic Republic of the Congo to lithium in Zambia and Zimbabwe to copper across much of southern Africa, the region holds enough mineral wealth to support the mass production of low\-car\- bon technologies\.8 Yet, resource curse dynamics are a threat where economic diversification is limited, in\- stitutions are weak and potential for resource capture is high\.

Even where conflict is less prevalent, many such projects are plagued by unsafe conditions, environ\- mental degradation and benefits that fail to accrue to the local communities\.9 Voluntary governance initia\- tives, such as limiting the sale of conflict diamonds, can help prevent green resource curse dynamics but require coordination across the supply chain of min\- eral producers, processers and consumers\.

The adverse impacts associated with renewable energy production have yet to reach the conflicts sparked by fossil fuel production\. But given the pro\- jected growth of renewable energy, active policy in\- terventions will be needed to reduce conflict risks associated with low\-carbon transitions\.10

##### The new uncertainty complex and intergenerational justice

__Krushil Watene \(Ngāti Manu, Te Hikutu, Ngāti Whātua o Orākei, Tonga\), __*Massey University, New Zealand*

Pursuing socioenvironmental justice now and leaving a thriving planet for the generations that follow require both knowledge and imagination\. Not only do we need to know how to pursue and realize such things as social justice and ecosystem health, but we also need to be able to imagine relationships and responsibilities far beyond our own temporally and spatially bound lives\. For instance, to “\[meet\] the needs of the present with\- out compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs,”1 we must both know what meeting needs requires now and be able to imagine what the lives of future generations might be like in a range of different and distant futures\.

Philosophers have developed several theories of intergenerational justice that animate the normative underpinnings of our responsibilities to future gen\- erations\.2 Some theories take the view that justice requires that we imagine ourselves choosing prin\- ciples to govern intergenerational responsibilities\. To enforce fairness, the choice procedure removes knowledge of exactly which generation we \(the deci\- sionmakers\) will belong to\.3 Other theories contend that justice requires that we imagine having to justify any courses of action we take now directly to our de\- scendants who will inherit the consequences of those actions\.4 For other theories justice requires that we imagine ourselves situated such that we must justify our actions now directly to our ancestors given their values, aspirations and expectations\.5 Similarly, other theories start out from the contention that justice re\- quires we imagine ourselves as part of connected and overlapping intergenerational communities extend\- ing backwards and forwards in time\.6 In line with this view Indigenous philosophies situate each genera\- tion as part of a “series of never\-ending beginnings”7

—each born in the imaginations of generations past, with the responsibility to set the course for the jour\- neys that follow\.8

Our cultural values, narratives and practices have a vital role in protecting and enabling intergenerational

links—connecting past, present and future genera\- tions\.9 Polynesian ocean\-voyaging narratives, for ex\- ample, trace descent lines across the expanses of the Pacific Ocean, the largest body of water on Earth, in some cases all the way to the Southern Ocean and Antarctica\.10 Land\-based narratives story ancestral migrations that weave networks of communities into the land and waterways—embedding connections and responsibilities through and across multiple genera\- tions\.11 Socioenvironmental practices enact values that preserve relationships and knowledge transmission\.12 Together, these theories, cultural values and practic\- es provide critical conceptual and cognitive tools that bridge distant people and places in ways that situate the current generation as having responsibilities as part of a far\-reaching intergenerational community\.13

Our theories, values and practices are grounded in the aspiration to leave behind a thriving planet\. This aspiration is reflected in the way we live our individ\- ual and collective lives hopeful that what we value, create and pursue will endure\. It is similarly reflected in the way we make policies based in part on the leg\- acies that those policies will chart and enable in the long run\. There tends to be, in other words, “a con\- ceptual connection between valuing something and wanting it to be sustained\.”14 Indeed, what we leave behind for future generations shapes not just how meaningful their lives will be but how meaningful our lives can be said to have been as well\.

The uncertainty complex outlined in this year’s Re\- port, while reinforcing this aspiration, highlights a more fundamental aspiration and challenge as well: namely, that there will be a future of some sort at all\. While previous generations have largely been able to take a stable planetary system for granted, our gen\- eration faces the challenge of ensuring the planet’s long\-term survival\. Such a predicament reinforces the urgent need for pathways through which differ\- ent ideas, fresh perspectives and appropriate socio\- environmental practices can be enabled and enacted

now\. More specifically, our collective challenge pro\- vides an opportunity to adopt the kind of long\-term intergenerational thinking that grounds Indigenous \(and many other\) philosophies—which Tim Mulgan refers to as “multigenerationalism\.”15 According to this view, the best way to find meaning in the world today is to embark on projects spanning several gen\- erations that come to fruition only long after the pres\- ent generation is gone\.

To do multigenerationalism well, or even at all, however, we must remember what we truly need to

flourish,16 and we must be courageous enough to re\- make our local and global systems in ways that will truly enable and sustain that flourishing\.17 What is more, we have to find the courage to radically change our values and narratives so that our descendants might still be here to pursue planetary wellbeing and justice long after we are gone\.18 Perhaps most impor\- tant, we must have “radical hope”19—we must hope for a world that we know may never materialize in the future and yet still find the courage to hold the course towards that future anyway\.

# Unsettled minds in uncertain times

### Mental distress—an obstacle to human development

PART I — UNCERTAIN TIMES, UNSETTLED LIVES 

<a id="_bookmark42"></a>__CHAPTER 2__

Unsettled minds in uncertain times:

Mental distress—an obstacle to human development

Unsettled lives mean unsettled minds\.

What does that have to do with human development?

This chapter makes the case that mental distress weighs on human development in many ways,

ultimately limiting people’s freedom to live the lives they have reason to value\. The effects are especially damaging to children and can perpetuate inequality in intergenerational cycles of mental distress and

socioeconomic hardship\. Breaking these cycles requires action from people and policymakers on three fronts: preventing distress, mitigating crises and building psychological resilience\.

74	HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2021/2022 

<a id="_bookmark43"></a>The preceding chapter documented the novel and unprecedented uncertainties affecting people’s lives\. This chapter dives into how uncertainty can cause mental distress,1 with implications for the way people feel, think, act and interact with each other through\- out their lives, restraining their freedom to achieve and to live lives they have reason to value\.2 It shows how mental distress can constrain human develop\- ment and reinforce and perpetuate inequalities\. It also emphasizes early childhood—as crucial for de\- veloping the brain and body but subject to the devas\- tating consequences of toxic stress\.

Mental wellbeing shapes the way people think, act and interact\.3 Individual emotion,4 perception, cog\- nition and motivation5 are set in a social context of circumstances, relationships and culture\.6 Emotions, such as anger, can drive people to interpersonal vi\- olence or to violent conflict, but they can also trig\- ger actions against injustices \(see chapter 3\)\.7 And emotions can help in dealing with an unpredictable world \(with some arguing that emotions reflect evo\- lutionary adaptations\)\.8 Healthy regulation of emo\- tions and overall mental wellbeing are crucial for peaceful and cohesive societies—and thus for human development\.

Healthy regulation of emotions and overall mental wellbeing are crucial for peaceful and cohesive societies— and thus for human development

“

Mental distress can hinder people from devel\- oping their full potential\.9 For instance, even when free high\-quality education is universally available, a student suffering from anxiety and insomnia has the choice to go to school but may not be able to con\- centrate because of mental distress and will thus not be able to learn as easily as her peers\. These individ\- ual limitations in one aspect of human development can be carried over to other dimensions and different

enables people to thrive despite adversity and that is intrinsically linked to agency, a critical component of human development \(see chapter 3\)\.10

How mental distress constrains human development

In the absence of psychological resilience, mental distress can result in mental disorders\. These are as\- sociated with poor education achievements,11 low productivity at work,12 poverty,13 premature and ex\- cess mortality14 and poor overall health\. Many people suffer from mental health–related problems, com\- monly measured by the number of diagnosed mental disorders \(spotlight 2\.1\)\.

To understand the links among mental distress, mental wellbeing and human development, the ca\- pabilities approach—focusing on the capabilities that enable people to expand their freedoms to do and be what they value and have reason to value— can be helpful\. Capabilities are a combination of things a person is able to do or be—the various functionings he or she can achieve\.15 Each person has his or her conversion function, with individual conversion fac\- tors that determine the ability to turn resources into capabilities \(figure 2\.1\)\.

While mental wellbeing can influence choices and behaviour at multiple stages and can be a function\- ing itself, mental distress shapes individual conver\- sion factors, affecting each person’s ability to convert goods and services into capabilities\. The complete set of achieved functionings also affects the amount and intensity of mental distress a person is exposed to\. For example, a person with high income can afford to live in a safe neighbourhood, but a person with low income may not\. So, the low\-income person will be exposed to more mental distress caused by neigh\- bourhood insecurity, which in turn will affect her con\- version factors\.

stages of the lifecycle, as when the same student later		

seeks employment, and can even act intergeneration\- ally through distress during pregnancy and beyond\.

A crucial task for people and policymakers is thus to prevent and mitigate mental distress\. Since not all adversity can be prevented or mitigated, this chapter and the policy options presented in chapter 6 empha\- size the importance of psychological resilience that

combined with weak support systems, impairs the de\- velopment of neural circuits responsible for emotion\- al self\-regulation, cognition and behaviour\.16 In some cases this creates long\-term physical and mental health problems, including damage to the developing brain\.17 A child’s developing brain sets the foundation for future learning, behaviour and health\.18 Damages are difficult, though not impossible, to remedy later in life\.

When stressors such as domestic violence, child maltreatment or extreme poverty activate the stress response system frequently or over an extended pe\- riod, physiological responses that usually deal with short\-term stress remain activated or become per\- manently calibrated to activate more easily and do not turn off as readily as they should\. They then can overwhelm the biological system \(called allostat\- ic overload\) and impair the development of neural connections \(figure 2\.2\)\.19 Abundant empirical ev\- idence shows that this process, apart from causing

\(chronic\) mental disorders, can increase the pos\- sibility of obesity, cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, substance abuse, autoimmune disease, im\- paired cognition and interpersonal and self\-directed violence\.20 And even without mental disorders, emo\- tions and cognition can be impaired with a similar effect on some parts of the body, since processes in the brain are linked with those in the microbiome and the gut\.21

These interactions shape the possibilities for learn\- ing, earning good income and leading a long and healthy life\. They can thus constrain the conversion function and the ability to turn resources into ca\- pabilities and may shape choices with potentially long\-lasting effects throughout the lifecycle\. Basic trust established during infancy22 and supportive re\- lationships with caregivers and other adults in the community can buffer some of these effects23 and build resilience\. Role models are especially im\- portant, as is perceived self\-efficacy—both shape

<a id="_bookmark45"></a>children’s aspirations and beliefs in how much they can achieve\.24 But when caregivers and other adults in the social network themselves face adversity or permanent stressors, these support structures may be weak or even counterproductive\. Severe maternal distress also seems to alter DNA\.25 Mothers’ exposure to adversity can increase defensive behaviour among offspring, which might be biologically useful in ma\- lign environments but can also lead to pathologies,

The interplay of individual, social and community factors can produce secure attachments, cognitive reappraisals, family cohesion, social structures and support networks\.27 Exposure to nature can also make a difference\. People, particularly children,28 who are frequently exposed to nature or spend much time outdoors tend to be more resilient to adversity and mental distress than those who do not\.29

even among children raised in safe environments		

after the adversity subsides\.26

Such children are not necessarily doomed for life\. Multiple biological, psychological, social and ecolog\- ical systems interact to build resilience, which helps them absorb some distress throughout the lifecycle\.

In adulthood

For adults severe mental distress can impair capa\- bilities in a similar way—but at a time when the de\- velopment of the brain and other organs is already

Still, adults who suffer from mental distress over an extended period have im\- paired conversion factors, resulting in constrained ca\- pability sets \(or freedoms to achieve\)\. That includes the ability to continue learning, to work and earn in\- come, to lead a long and healthy life, to have attach\- ments to things and people, to form perceptions of good and bad, to plan one’s own life, to affiliate with others, to care about other species and to enjoy rec\- reational activities30—even if external conditions are favourable\. Some external conditions, such as access to information or health services, can also help build psychological resilience among adults, which can ab\- sorb some of the stress and provide room to deal with future adversity\.31 Mental health at older ages part\-

The Anthropocene context is a driver of uncertain\- ty without precedent in human history\. It is manifest not only in climate change but also in biodiversity loss and the depletion and contamination of natural resources\.33 Efforts to ease planetary pressures are also a source of uncertainty, driving real or perceived threats associated with the transitions in economic and social systems in a context of rapid digital trans\- formation\. Precarious jobs, digital inequality, cyber\- attacks, data fraud and concentrated digital power can all cause serious mental distress\. This section discusses evidence showing how these manifesta\- tions of uncertainty affect mental wellbeing and can also drive inequalities in human development\.

In uncertain times mental distress among individ\- uals can have costs for societies, as it restrains peo\- ple from reaching their full potential throughout the lifecycle—thus constraining human development\. And since different people are exposed to different levels of mental distress, it can increase inequalities and even perpetuate them when distress is trans\- ferred from caregivers to children\.

Unsettled minds amid multidimensional uncertainties

New and persistent drivers of insecurity unsettle peo\- ple’s lives in the context of uncertainty \(see chap\- ter 1\)\. They include multiple forms of violence, which comprise violent conflict between groups and inter\- personal violence, ranging from domestic to neigh\- bourhood violence\. Other stressors may not always threaten physical wellbeing but can still cause serious mental distress: discrimination, exclusion, econom\- ic insecurity and uncertainties associated either with the more frequent and extreme hazards of the An\- thropocene or with transitions and rapid technologi\- cal change, as with digitalization\.

Minds pressured in the Anthropocene

As discussed in chapter 1, dangerous planetary change in the Anthropocene is reflected in climate change, biodiversity loss and the more frequent emergence or re\-emergence of zoonotic diseases, with Covid\-19 likely the latest\. The effects on mental wellbeing run through several channels:

- *Traumatizing events\. *The increase in extreme weather events often goes hand in hand with losses or damages of housing or crops as well as injuries and even deaths of loved ones\. These experiences can cause tremendous human suffering, often leading to post\-traumatic stress \(spotlight 2\.2\), anxiety, depression, distress, grief, survivor guilt, substance abuse and even suicide\.34
- *Physical illness\. *Exposure to extreme heat can cause heat exhaustion, leading to mental distress\.35 And sharp spikes in temperature cause irritability, more aggressive thoughts and feelings, and even vio\- lent behaviour\.36 Following distress and grief that Covid\-19 has caused around the world \(see below\), the constant possibility of another deadly variant or a new zoonotic disease also pressures minds in the Anthropocene\.
- *General climate\- or eco\-anxiety and solastalgia\. *Climate change can have two different effects on people, depending partly on psychological resil\- ience\. It increases general anxiety and worries about the future,37 which encourages some people to become agents for climate action but may leave others feeling anxious and incapable of changing

<a id="_bookmark47"></a>anything\.38 Young people claim that governments around the world have dismissed or neglected their requests for urgent action\.39 Indigenous peoples from around the world, among the most affected by climate change, have suffered mental distress over seasonal changes and acute weather events\.40

- 
	- *Food insecurity\. *With increasing extreme weather events disrupting food production and access, food insecurity is on the rise again after decades of decline\.41 In addition to being a threat to phys\- ical health, it is also a serious mental stressor\.42 It has been associated with psychological distress in both low and high human development countries\.43 In several African countries women and older people are especially affected\. The most effective interventions target livelihoods as opposed to income only\.44
	- *Biodiversity loss\. *Biodiversity loss can drive mental distress, especially among indigenous and mar\- ginalized communities, leading to longer\-term adverse psychological and behavioural impacts, such as increased family stress, amplification of previous trauma, greater likelihood of substance abuse and higher prevalence of suicide ideation\.45 While causal mechanisms are yet to be fully under\- stood, some reasons can include that biodiversity loss causes disruptions to physical health through altered food systems or leads to a different sense of place that can undermine cultural practices and knowledge systems\. Moreover, it can impair self\-determination by reducing the sufficiency of locally available resources, and it can result in a loss of social capital as community members rely increasingly on outside sources of aid and income rather than on one another\.46

The adverse consequences of climate change are already affecting people who more directly depend on agriculture and natural resources for their live\- lihoods, including those in communities in rural, coastal, mountainous or forest areas, many of them indigenous\.47 Since many of these people live in low\- income countries and are already disadvantaged, mental distress and its effects on the conversion fac\- tors can further increase inequalities in freedoms to achieve\.

The depletion of natural resources and land\-use changes through deforestation and for agricultur\- al use are putting pressures on biodiversity and

threatening the integrity of ecosystem functions, with several unknown threats potentially to come, includ\- ing more frequent zoonotic diseases\.48 As discussed in chapter 1, the Covid\-19 pandemic may be the latest but surely will not be the last, with implications that include multiple lockdowns all over the world that may cause mental distress in the future as they did during Covid\-19\.49

Biodiversity loss can drive mental distress, especially among indigenous and marginalized communities, leading to longer\-term adverse psychological and behavioural impacts

“

During the first year of the Covid\-19 pandemic, the global prevalence of depression and anxiety in\- creased by more than 25 percent\.50 The increase was greater among women than men, most likely because women were more affected by the socio\- economic consequences of lockdowns\.51 In a global survey 77 percent of respondents reported moderate to severe stress and poor sleep, and 59 percent suf\- fered from anxiety and 35 percent from depression \(only 18 percent had previously been diagnosed with a mental disorder\)\.52 Young people suffered—most likely because of missed opportunities during multi\- ple lockdowns\.53 People with low incomes, struggling to afford basic needs such as rent and food, suffered disproportionally in several countries\.54

Women, who took on most of the additional do\- mestic and care work that emerged during school closures and lockdowns,55 faced more mental dis\- tress than before the Covid\-19 pandemic\.56 A cross\- country survey found that 27 percent of women struggled with mental distress, compared with 10 percent of men\. Women cited their escalating un\- paid care burden as a critical stressor, alongside con\- cerns about food, healthcare and livelihoods\. Given the links among employment, income, food security and mental health, it is noteworthy that 55 percent of women reported income loss as the top impact of the pandemic \(compared with 34 percent of men\) and that 41 percent of women \(versus 30 percent of men\) reported not having enough food\.57 Ethnic minorities of both sexes were severely affected in the United Kingdom, with the largest increase in mental distress among men with a background from Bangladesh, India or Pakistan \(figure 2\.3\)\.58

More than two years into the Covid\-19 pandemic, worries about the virus have somewhat dissipated in parts of the world\. But anxiety about new variants— and the possibility of mandatory quarantines, lock\- downs and cancellations—remains around the globe\. The abrupt halt and related uncertainty that the pan\- demic inflicted on many people’s lives will likely lin\- ger for some time\.

__*Economic insecurity drives mental distress*__

Economic insecurity—expressed in periods of low in\- come, unemployment, poor working conditions, pov\- erty, housing instability and financial shocks— can cause mental distress\. Even the perception that such outcomes could materialize may give people reason to worry, particularly in contexts of economic precar\- iousness or dislocations\. And even when these dislo\- cations are transitory or small relative to the scale of an economy, they can loom as scary threats in par\- ticular regions or sectors\.59

The causal relation also works in reverse: people with impaired mental \(and physical\) health have fewer

employment opportunities and can face income pen\- alties for their conditions\.60 Especially in economic contexts where brain\-based skills such as emotional in\- telligence, creativity, cognitive flexibility, self\-control or system thinking matter more than manual skills,61 mental wellbeing is increasingly important to thrive in the professional world, while the lack of it can further exacerbate disadvantages\. In other contexts where people work in agriculture, they are being increasingly exposed to the stresses of extreme weather events that jeopardize their source of income and food security— and with it both physical and mental wellbeing\.

The association of economic insecurity with men\- tal distress starts very early in life, indeed in the mother’s womb\. Some foetuses are exposed to more stress and worry related to poverty, malnutrition, vi\- olence or environmental irritants associated with poverty \(such as pollution or extreme temperatures\) than others\.62 The intergenerational effect contin\- ues during childhood when parents’ mental distress impairs children’s wellbeing, with effects into adult\- hood\.63 If the situation continues throughout child\- hood, this can lead to long\-term adaptive behaviour and pathologies that are hard to break later in life\.64 For instance, children who grow up with food insecu\- rity often continue binge eating even after hardship is overcome\.65 These effects can be buffered by social institutions or informal aid in the community, such as cash transfers to mothers, which have been shown to improve infant brain activity and subsequent cogni\- tive skills and mental wellbeing\.66

Even less severe conditions of low socioeconomic status and related social structures can affect chil\- dren’s brain and body development, cognitive func\- tioning and mental and physical health\. For example, children in families who live in crowded, chaotic or noisy conditions or unsafe neighbourhoods and who lack organization and daily routines are usually exposed to higher mental distress\.67 And the belief in how much one is capable of achieving—which is usually lower in low socioeconomic status families

— can diminish children’s aspirations and achieve\- ments\.68 These factors can accumulate,69 which is in line with models of cumulative advantage and dis\- advantage that look at socioeconomic disparities in general and health disparities in particular\.70 The 2019 Human Development Report analysed in de\- tail how this mechanism acts in intergenerational

<a id="_bookmark49"></a>ways, perpetuating multidimensional inequalities in human development\.71

During adulthood perceived and actual economic insecurity as well as anticipated future downside risks are detrimental for mental wellbeing at all incomes, especially for men\.72 Income shocks have been shown to increase suicides in some contexts, an effect that can be mitigated by cash transfers\.73 One of the most serious economic threats to mental wellbeing stems from repeated financial shocks, such as income loss, especially for poor people and for men\.74 Shocks al\- ready experienced, such as unemployment, worsen expectations for the future and reduce life satisfac\- tion\.75 Continued employment is not only important to avoid financial stress; it also has positive psychosocial effects, such as stimulating the feeling of belonging to a community and contributing productively to society\.76 Persistent low incomes are also associated with poorer mental health and wellbeing, especially when generating a sense of scarcity or insufficiency com\- pared with peers in the community\.77 People at the lower end of the income spectrum suffer from mental

distress 1\.5–3 times as often as people at the higher end78 and are more likely to experience violent crime and traumatic events,79 which can make some people want to leave their place of origin \(box 2\.1\)\. However, even people with higher incomes can experience re\- sentment and frustrations due to financial concerns, especially when aspirations are very high and the so\- cial environment is such that people perceive high in\- equality compared with their peers\.80

Status incongruence is an important concept here\. For example, having a high level of education in a manual occupation or low\-skilled nonmanual occupa\- tion has been shown to cause emotional discomfort, such as feelings of shame and anxiety,81 pessimistic outlooks and overall poor mental wellbeing\. With rising education levels and labour markets that are unable to absorb all qualified labour, cases of status incongruence have increased and are expected to be\- come even more prevalent\.82 Positive expectations and belief in the ability to achieve one’s goals can par\- tially compensate for negative effects on mental well\- being\.83 Finally, at older ages a higher debt burden

__Box 2\.1 Multidimensional uncertainties may make some people subject to human trafficking—another source of severe mental distress__

Multidimensional uncertainties make some people want to look for a better future elsewhere\. But bureaucratic ob\- stacles often stand in the way of free migration, so that some people fall victim to human trafficking\. Networks of organized crime consisting of traffickers typically make false promises of education or job opportunities using fraudulent employment agencies to trick victims before applying violence and coercion\.1 The experience of being trafficked is often traumatic, with restriction of movement and violence, and fear of being discovered, detained and deported\.2 An Ethiopia\-based study found that among human trafficked returnees the prevalence of depression was about 58 percent, that of anxiety 52 percent and that of post\-traumatic stress disorder \(PTSD\) 35 percent\. Restricted movement was associated with anxiety, depression and PTSD, whereas experiencing violence during trafficking was linked to anxiety and PTSD\. Detention contributed to all three disorders\.3

A study of trafficked women and girls from Monterrey and Reynosa \(Mexico\) found that all of the study’s participants were experiencing feelings of tension, stress, anxiety, worry and anger and that most of them were crying more than usual \(86 percent\), lacking appetite \(86 percent\) and having suicidal thoughts \(80 percent\)\.4 Among human trafficking survivors in the Greater Mekong subregion, men, women and children who had experienced violence during traffick\- ing faced a higher prevalence of anxiety, depression and PTSD than those who did not\.5 In addition to experiencing mental distress, many victims of human trafficking do not find what they had expected at their destination but face new challenges, such as adaptation to a new environment and sometimes even dependence and human rights violations from their traffickers\.

From a human development perspective human trafficking takes away people’s agency and freedoms as well as the possibility for them to make their own choices and determine their futures\. Managing safe migration is crucial to tackling human trafficking and should be taken up through cooperation and partnership among countries\.

Causality also runs the other way\. Mental distress lowers people’s ability to work productively and dis\- torts the way people think, with consequences for the way they search for work, interact with people and carry out their work\.88 Alleviating financial worries improves workers’ productivity, making them more attentive, faster and less prone to mistakes,89 as pov\- erty appears to burden cognitive capacity \(but see the discussion in chapter 3 suggesting that the burden may be contingent on social context\)\.90 It can also modify the content of cognition, adding a monetary perspective to many dimensions of life, which is diffi\- cult to suppress and may shape decisionmaking and

social relationships\.91 Conversely, poverty alleviation can improve socialization and other noncognitive skills, such as agreeableness and conscientiousness, while diminishing hostility and aggression\.92

Severe mental distress can undermine physical health, which can lead to an inability to carry out cer\- tain work—and increase health spending where there are gaps in health insurance or public provision of health services\.93 Furthermore, mental distress can result in job loss or income decline, not least because it affects preferences, beliefs, cognitive functioning and ultimately economic decisionmaking\.94 People with depression earn about 34 percent less than the average person, people with bipolar disorder about 38 percent less and people with schizophrenia about 74 percent less\. People with these conditions also face a much higher risk of no income and disability\.95 And the lack of income can cause even more men\- tal distress\. The circular relation has been found to nearly double the negative impact of financial shocks, explaining low financial resilience in a long\-term mental distress–poverty trap\.96

The circular and intergenerational relation between economic insecurity and mental distress can perpetu\- ate economic inequality across generations \(figure 2\.4\)\.

and connect people from different parts of the world\. They can even accelerate the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals \(SDGs\)\.97 A recent study covering more than 200 countries found that mobile phone access was associated with higher gen\- der equality through multiple channels \(lower mater\- nal mortality, better information about sexual and reproductive health services, higher empowerment to make independent decisions, with larger gains among the least developed countries and among the most disadvantaged groups\)\.98 In this sense digitali\- zation can contribute to empowerment, essential for mental wellbeing\.

But the benefits of these new technologies also come with challenges\. Digitalization poses sever\-

al social and economic threats, including, but not limited to, lower labour demand for some tasks,99 digital inequality and exclusion,100 cybercrime and the related theft of financial resources and personal information,101 transfer of decisionmaking powers to machines, digital power concentration,102 digital addictions103 and violence,104 and reduced personal life security\.105 One of the most serious challenges of digitalization is digital inequality\.106 Poor peo\- ple and those with existing mental disorders have a higher probability of being digitally excluded, which potentially increases inequalities in other areas\.107

Some of these challenges can cause mental dis\- tress, despite the fact that some of the benefits of digital technologies foster mental wellbeing \(figure 2\.5\)\. For instance, cyberharassment and cyberstalk\- ing have been associated with anxiety, panic attacks, suicidal ideation108 and depression\.109 Mobile devices, social networks and cloud computing services can be used to stalk people and conduct surveillance\.110 Dig\- ital platforms such as Facebook, Instagram and Twit\- ter can be used in a similar way as well as for social comparison, negative interactions, cyberbullying, and sharing violent content and violent or discrim\- inative language\.111 This has been associated with mental distress and suicidal behaviour, with the highest prevalence among girls\.112 Older people may feel excluded from socialization when the younger

generation spends time on social media or with other technologies\.

Digital exclusion can be found among healthcare services\. While digital healthcare services can pro\- vide substantial benefits for people with fast internet connections and digital skills—and thus have poten\- tial to widen access to health services among some remote populations \(box 2\.2\)—people without these advantages are less likely to benefit from services\.113

While access to information can be empowering, abundant and sometimes false information \(which is easy to distribute through social media\) can also be a source of anxiety\. Not only can people feel anxious because of too much and sometimes contradictory information, but they may also stress about infor\- mation that is not even true\. During the early stag\- es of the Covid\-19 pandemic, and often continuing beyond, false information about the virus, its cures and vaccines went viral on communication platforms such as Facebook and Twitter, causing anxiety in many people\.114 The abundance of information seems to constitute a stressor \(information overload\), mak\- ing it more likely that people share false information\.115 Another way digitalization can cause men\-

tal distress is obsessive use of digital technol\- ogies, digital platforms and digital devices\.116 Obsessive smartphone use can result in chronic sleep

<a id="_bookmark52"></a>__Box 2\.2 Potential of telehealth for increasing access to mental healthcare__

Digitalization can improve health systems and the provision of healthcare services1 if digital technologies are readily available to the whole population\. Mobile and electronic interventions allow easy access to mental health services and information on prevention, counselling and treatment\.2 Telehealth, which involves telephone or video via various web\-based applications,3 has gained global prominence over the years\. By 2016 more than 50 percent of countries that responded to a World Health Organization survey reported having a national telehealth policy, about 70 percent claimed to have a teleradiology programme and approximately 25 percent said they had conducted a telehealth programme evaluation\.4 In many parts of Africa, particularly in rural areas populated mostly by young people, there is great potential for expanding telehealth services\.5 The Covid\-19 pandemic massively increased telehealth pro\- grammes and platforms\. In the United Kingdom the proportion of doctor’s appointments over the phone or by video call increased from 13 percent in 2019 to 48 percent by mid\-2020\.6 In some East Asia and Pacific countries7 and in the United States,8 the number of telehealth users more than doubled in the first month of the pandemic\.

Since most mental health services do not require physical examinations, digital services are especially promising, allowing people from remote areas to get help online without traveling long distances\. Such services can be more time and cost efficient, providing support while people wait for face\-to\-face interventions\.9

Undermining these benefits are poor network infrastructure, inadequate funding to support telehealth programmes, competing health system priorities, internet access inequalities and a lack of digital skills among all or parts of the population\.10 So for digital mental health interventions to improve health outcomes without increasing inequality, countries need to increase telehealth budgets, expand internet access in deprived communities and empower people from these communities through education and training on how to use digital devices and platforms\.

Cybercrime, such as fraud, theft, scams and other forms of online financial exploitation, can cause ex\- cessive worrying and anxiety and has been linked to depression among older adults\.121 Moreover, inter\-

Violence scares, unsettles and scars lives

Given the direct threat to physical integrity, most forms of violence cause mental distress, often lead\- ing to mental disorders such as post\-traumatic stress disorder \(PTSD\), anxiety and depression, and each form of violence comes with additional challenges depending on context and setting\. Interpersonal vi\- olence includes domestic and community violence, such as intimate partner violence, child or elder abuse and assaults by strangers\. Collective violence occurs between larger groups, such as organized crime and armed conflicts\.127

net use reduces offline interaction, political partici\-		

pation and civic cultural engagement,122 increasing the likelihood of social isolation\.123 By contrast, dig\- ital technology can also create social engagement opportunities that help eliminate loneliness and so\- cial isolation124 and improve wellbeing125—for exam\- ple, by connecting to people with similar interests or problems over long distances \(self\-help forums\)\. By doing so, digital technology can also alleviate mental distress\.126

__*Interpersonal violence can increase inequalities in opportunity*__

Psychologically, domestic violence is extremely toxic, as the home is a place that should provide protection and safety, constituting a location to rest and relax away from other environmental stressors\. When sev\- eral forms of domestic violence happen simultane\- ously, they can create a vicious cycle of dependence

<a id="_bookmark53"></a>and abuse\. For instance, the perpetrator controls the household’s financial resources, making the victim financially dependent,128 while invoking fear and un\- dermining self\-worth and self\-esteem through verbal abuse, constant criticism and social isolation, which can lead to a withdrawal from the labour force, hous\- ing stress and ultimately a loss of self\-identity\.129 The key here is dominance over the partner through emo\- tional, economic or psychological abuse,130 which then substantially limits the possibilities to escape physical violence as well\. This mechanism is reflected in data showing that in countries with lower female labour force participation, more women experience intimate partner violence \(figure 2\.6\)\. While men can certainly also be affected, the majority of intimate partner violence survivors are women\.131

Bisexual and gay men report worse psychologi\- cal consequences following intimate partner vio\- lence than straight men\.132 This is possibly due to

the combined burden of mental stressors, including discrimination, and social pressures of internalized masculinity norms suggesting that men should be more resistant to oppression and violence\.133 Due to gender stereotypes in some criminal justice systems, there also appears to be hesitance to report assaults out of fear of being misjudged as the perpetrator\. In various country contexts men who had filed police reports recounted that authorities had responded to their plea for help with suspicion, ridicule or even arrest\.134

When older people live in a household with fami\- ly members, which is common in some cultural con\- texts, domestic violence can also be directed towards them, affecting their physical and mental health\.135 This happens more frequently among older people with physical disabilities \(49 percent\) and with psy\- chological disabilities \(7 percent\)\. Many, but not all, affected older people are female \(63 percent\)\.136

<a id="_bookmark54"></a>The consequences of domestic violence for mental wellbeing range from milder symptoms such as ele\- vated psychological stress to full\-fledged clinical pres\- entations of mental disorders such as PTSD, phobias, substance abuse, depression and anxiety\.137 Survivors of physical domestic violence are also prone to trau\- matic brain injury, with devastating consequences for their ability to function in society, including to work and socialize\.138 All of this can eventually result in a loss of agency, when individuals no longer feel able to shape and change their circumstances, lose hope al\- together and become vulnerable to revictimization\.139

More than half the world’s children ages 2–17— around a billion—have experienced emotional, physical or sexual violence, with devastating consequences for their mental wellbeing

“

Even when physical attacks are not targeted to\- wards them, children are affected through three channels:

- Witnessing attacks on one of their caregivers\.
- PTSD symptoms of caregivers that undermine quality of care\.
- Traumatizing parenting styles or emotional un\- availability that emerge as a result of caregivers’ mental distress\.140

When children themselves fall victim to psycho\- logical, sexual or physical abuse, mental distress is most severe\. More than half the world’s children ages 2–17—around a billion—have experienced emotional, physical or sexual violence\.141 When stressors come

aligned interventions are crucial here, as discussions of domestic violence are still taboo in many societies, hindering social workers from intervening and mak\- ing mental health treatments available for children\.

Community violence ranges from isolated acts of assault by strangers or acquaintances, such as bully\- ing, armed robbery and sexual abuse, to workplace and institutional violence\.145 Neighbourhoods are not simply the physical locations in which we reside; they are also places with intricate socioeconomic–spa\- tial connections \(box 2\.3\)\.146 While neighbourhood characteristics—including education and healthcare facilities, transport connectivity and crime levels as well as perceived safety and social cohesion—may affect outcomes such as health, education and in\- come,147 these same outcomes in turn determine which neighbourhoods are accessible to people\.148 This effect constitutes an obstacle to intra\- and inter\- generational mobility, as it can trap people in cycles of low income, poor health and education, and sur\- roundings prone to amplifying these disadvantages\.149 Mental distress is an additional risk factor in this trap, given its consequences for cognition, productivity and overall functioning\.150 For children, who typically depend on their parents’ housing decisions, the effect is equally strong, if not more severe, since they are much more vulnerable to mental distress than adults \(see the first section of this chapter\)\.151 Taken to\- gether, these factors can perpetuate inequalities, not only between neighbourhoods but also between cit\- ies, countries and regions, as levels of violence vary across different areas\.

from outside the home, stable relationships with car\-		

egivers typically function as buffers for children’s mental wellbeing\. But when caregivers become ag\- gressors, one of the most important instincts—trust in caregivers—becomes damaged, equalling betray\- al by the people the child depends on\.142 It impairs basic trust in life and can have severe long\-term, and sometimes irreversible, consequences for children’s psychological and physical health as well as for their overall functioning, causing what is called complex childhood or developmental trauma\.143 The conver\- sion function of these children thus differs from those of children who grew up in a nonviolent household, unless a very favourable combination of resilient building factors comes together and absorbs part of the toxic stress the child has suffered\.144 Culturally

__*Collective violence can increase inequalities between groups of people*__

In some areas of the world, the root cause of neigh\- bourhood violence is organized crime\. People who reside in neighbourhoods where drug cartels or other criminal groups operate experience more mental distress, not least because of the perceived threat of violence\. Evidence from Mexico shows that informa\- tion about brutal acts, such as executions, and about violent confrontations between the local police and criminal groups has caused substantial mental dis\- tress for community members\. On some occasions this information may be diffused purposely to in\- stil fear in the community\.152 Mental distress caused

<a id="_bookmark55"></a>__Box 2\.3 Neighbourhood violence is bad, but uncertainty around it can make it even worse__

Direct exposure to violence and the possibility of experiencing violence as a resident of a neighbour\- hood that is perceived as unsafe are significant risk factors for mental distress\. Across Buenos Aires, Lima, Medellín, Mexico City and São Paulo expo\- sure to interpersonal violence—for example, being beaten up, witnessing death or someone getting in\- jured, being mugged or threatened with a weapon, and sexual violence—and the experience of living in neighbourhoods with a higher prevalence of violent crime \(after individual violence exposure is accounted for\) are associated with higher odds of anxiety and mood disorders\.1

In Baltimore, Maryland, survey respondents liv\- ing in violent crime hotspots report higher rates of depression \(61 percent higher\) and post\-traumatic stress disorder \(85 percent higher\) than residents in coldspots\.2 Depression can be caused by indirect exposure or other factors related to living in violent neighbourhoods\. In some cases the perceived level of violence in the neighbourhood and the uncer\- tainty around being exposed to it can be at least as

Mental distress can also be exacerbated by an interplay of other factors\. Several of these factors in a population\- based survey of adults living in a group of *favelas *\(slums\) in Rio de Janeiro—specifically being younger, female or unemployed; having a lower income; and having experienced and fearing neighbourhood violence—were separately and significantly associated with poorer mental health outcomes\. These factors, together with past experiences of violence and the fear of violence, were also significantly associated with higher levels of mental distress\.4

by organized crime is not limited to victims and the community\. Members of criminal groups also suffer from mental distress because of chronic exposure to violence, potentially increasing cycles of violence, as some types of mental distress can result in aggressive behaviour\.153

Violence during protests, riots and clashes with the police can cause emotional imbalances, fears, wor\- ries and even psychological trauma\. Over the past decade protests, sometimes accompanied by related political violence, increased substantially, until the

Covid\-19 pandemic hit \(figure 2\.7\)\.154 When political climates change and authorities do not fully respect the right to freedom of expression, people may sense repression and start feeling impotent or powerless\.

Sometimes, frustration throughout the population can also turn into clashes between protesters and police, causing mental distress\.

getting full\-blown panic attacks\.”155 The effect can be as severe as the ones caused by armed conflict, in which WHO estimates the PTSD rate to be a little over 21 percent\.156 A study from Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China, found a combined prevalence of depression and PTSD of 21\.8 percent among the adult population during the 2019–2020 social unrest\. There was also a strong association between heavy politics\-related social media use and mental distress, attributable to emotion contagion\.157 Following violence in Syrian Arab Republic, civilians expressed panic attacks, especially towards the pos\- sibility of “disappearing” while being transferred in detainment\.158 The Syrian conflict also shows how collective violence, such as riots, battles or violence against civilians can escalate into armed conflicts and civil wars\.159

When that happens, severe and long\-lasting men\- tal distress can be the consequence for large parts of the population, given the nature of traumatic experiences related to war settings\. From the early 2000s until the outbreak of the war in Ukraine, there have been few interstate conflicts, but the past decade has witnessed a surge in battle\-related

deaths due to civil conflicts, some subject to foreign state interventions\.160 In postwar settings about one in five people suffer from mental health conditions\.161 PTSD is very common among war survivors, affect\- ing about 354 million adult war survivors,162 not least because of the direct threat to experiencing vi\- olence and the constant possibility of loss or injury of loved ones\.163 Grief and sadness have been relat\- ed to addictive behaviour, particularly to increased substance abuse\.164 This may put an additional bur\- den on public health systems, considering the long\- term consequences of substance abuse for mental and physical health\.

Globally comparative data on the prevalence of PTSD remains a challenge, but more specific exam\- ples from war torn countries can provide deeper in\- sights into the number of affected people and into the mechanisms and causalities behind them\. Due to recurrent wars and armed conflicts in Iraq, for ex\- ample, the prevalence of PTSD among young people ages 17–19 is 25 percent,165 and more than two\-thirds of adult men suffer from anxiety and emotional in\- stability\.166 In Nigeria the Boko Haram insurgency has contributed to major mental distress, including

<a id="_bookmark57"></a>severe emotional disorders, psychological distress, psychotic disorders, PTSD and depression\.167 The militia sexually assaults women and girls,168 leading to social isolation, depression and suicidal ideation\.169 Military personnel stationed in Nigerian armed con\- flict zones also have a high probability of suffering from PTSD and avoidance symptoms\.170 But survi\- vors are often not diagnosed with PTSD and do not identify their condition as such\. There are other, cul\- turally aligned explanations for what people feel and go through, and following those, people may seek al\- ternative approaches to integrative health and men\- tal wellbeing\.171

About 450 million children— or one in six— currently live in conflict zones, with devastating consequences for their mental health,172 including PTSD\.173 The PTSD prevalence rate was 44 percent among child survivors of the Rwandan genocide and 87 percent among children exposed to the bomb\- ings in Gaza\.174 In Nigeria Boko Haram has recruited young children to join its militia, causing severe men\- tal distress associated with warfare\.175 Some of these effects can be long\-lasting if not adequately treated: children who survived the Viet Nam war show in\- creased symptoms of depression in adulthood\.176

Apart from the threat to physical integrity, armed conflicts can expose people to displacement, de\- stroy critical infrastructure, disrupt supply chains, hinder investment and thus undermine economic growth and development, possibly resulting in mas\- sive unemployment—all adding to mental distress of large parts of the population\.177 When armed conflict forces people to leave their homes, this complicates

networks\. And if they flee to another country, possi\- bly even their civic duties, access to social services, professions, occupational identity and much else—all risk factors for mental distress that affect people’s ca\- pabilities sets\.182 In such an environment where peo\- ple suffer from impaired health, limited education opportunities and unemployment, mental distress is more likely to set in but less likely to be treated be\- cause resources are desperately needed on all ends\. Indeed, countries experiencing conflict present the widest gap between people who need mental health\- care services and people who have access to them\.183 Community\-level approaches are promising for facil\- itating access to mental healthcare services in these settings \(box 2\.4\)\.

Some groups of people have been excluded, disrespected and discriminated against for centuries, with devastating effects on their mental wellbeing and human development at large

“

Because some groups of people are affected more by violence than others, and thus suffer more from mental distress than others, the alteration of their conversion factors limits their freedom to achieve and thus increases inequality of opportunity across neighbourhoods, districts and even countries, de\- pending on the level of violence people are experi\- encing \(and on access to mental healthcare services and other resources that can mitigate distress\)\. More\- over, the exposure to violence can itself create vicious cycles of even more violence if left unattended\.

the overall situation even further\. As of mid\-2022 at		

least 100 million people are estimated to have been forcibly displaced from their homes worldwide due to conflict, with major displacements in Afghanistan, Burkina Faso, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, Myanmar, Nigeria and Ukraine\.178

The war in Ukraine has caused a major increase in displaced people, with more than 7 million internal\- ly displaced persons and more than 5\.6 million refu\- gees\.179 Children, who account for about half of the displaced, become exposed to all sorts of mental dis\- tress\.180 Globally, there are now nearly 37 million dis\- placed children—the highest number ever recorded\.181 When displaced, people may lose their material pos\- sessions, community affiliations and social support

Discrimination unsettles minds by attacking human dignity

Some groups of people—including women; certain ethnic groups; people of colour; people who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, inter\- sex or other sexual minority \(LGBTQI\+\); and people with disabilities—have been excluded, disrespected and discriminated against for centuries, with devas\- tating effects on their mental wellbeing and human development at large\. At the institutional level dis\- criminatory norms and laws of some countries still bias the criminal justice system and block access to high\-quality education and health services, economic

<a id="_bookmark58"></a>__Box 2\.4 Tackling mental distress at the community level__

The rationale behind community\-based mental health services is that they tend to have greater acceptability among the population—and better accessibility and affordability than most other healthcare options\. They typically enable family involvement, are less prone to stigma and discrimination, promote mental health awareness and have en\- hanced clinical effectiveness given the involvement of trusted local providers\.1 One example is the Mental Health Innovation Network’s Basic Needs Mental Health and Development Model, which has reached more than 650,000 people and their family members in different low\- and middle\-income countries\. It has increased access to treatment among service users by 84 percent, and users have reported a 75 percent reduction in symptoms—all while costing only $9\.67 a month per person\.2 In some countries, including Rwanda, South Sudan and Mexico, tackling mental distress at the community level has become an important part of the public health strategy\.

__*Rwanda*__

The 1994 genocide in Rwanda has had numerous long\-lasting adverse effects on mental health among citizens, including high rates of depression and post\-traumatic stress disorder \(PTSD\)\.3 Like other countries, Rwanda has made efforts to address the population’s mental distress\. In seeking to ensure the availability of mental health services at the community level by 2024,4 the government has used several strategies, such as establishing mental health facilities in all community units and health centres, enhancing the quality of mental healthcare by constructing a Na\- tional Mental Health Care Center, and improving reporting and surveillance systems to manage and conduct patient follow\-ups\.5 Over time the government has decentralized mental healthcare and maintained at least one psychologist and psychiatric nurse per hospital\.6 Such interventions help the people who suffer from mental disorders to heal, to establish strong social networks at the community level and to become emotionally more resilient\.7

__*South Sudan*__

South Sudan’s people also struggle with mental distress, such as depression, anxiety and PTSD caused by conflict, violence, economic hardship and poor access to healthcare, among others\.8 To help people suffering from mental distress, including those who have experienced armed conflict and violence, the International Committee of the Red Cross’s mental health teams provide counselling services in South Sudanese health facilities such as primary healthcare centres, physical rehabilitation centres and surgical wards\.9 This approach is similar to the Rwandan one in that it tries to leverage local public health infrastructure and trusted networks to spread access to mental healthcare\.

__*Mexico*__

Mexico’s mental health policy involves increasing public mental health awareness, community care and outpatient services as well as keeping the need for hospitalization to a minimum, among others\.10 Specifically, to address mental disorders, Mexico uses the community mental healthcare model, which involves developing outpatient clinics, reha\- bilitation centres and sheltered homes,11 to ensure access to mental health services even in remote areas\.12

Structural discrimination and racism have been found to increase overall health disparities through several channels,185 including mental distress, envi\- ronmental adversities and unequal healthcare\.186 Dis\- crimination can be seen as a latent form of violence,

<a id="_bookmark59"></a>constituting a psychological stressor that has been empirically related to depression; anxiety; delinquent behaviour; alcohol, tobacco and drug use as coping mechanisms; metabolic disease; cardiovascular dis\- ease; low birth weight; and prematurity\.187 Structur\- al or systemic discrimination can sometimes turn into actual violence, going hand in hand with human rights violations\. The most extreme case is genocide, but other forms of human rights violations and dis\- respect of human dignity have left entire minority groups, such as the Rohingya or Yazidi populations, with serious mental health problems as well\.188 Ex\- clusion and discrimination can impair certain groups’ mental wellbeing, as with migrants who struggle in adapting to the host country, specifically with cultur\- al congruity, identity and even bereavement\.189 Cul\- turally aligned healing approaches are especially important here, because different people believe in different things, which may alter the effectiveness of some mental health interventions\.

In the case of racism, the effect on mental well\- being can be intergenerational: vicarious racism

—that is racism experienced by parents and then transmitted to children— can affect children’s men\- tal, physical and socioemotional health \(some exam\- ples include increased body mass index, depression, anxiety, substance use, delays in cognitive develop\- ment and increased healthcare use for sick visits\)\.190 This effect runs mainly through children’s increased threat perception, harsher parenting practices, more complicated parent–child relationships and racial socialization—that is the information children re\- ceive about race and racism\.191 Younger children are at higher risk of developing long\-term defensive pat\- terns when indirectly exposed to racism \(see above about the effects of threat on long\-term behaviour\- al consequences\)\. Children who are affected by dis\- crimination and have insufficient psychological resilience or resources to build it may become even more disadvantaged with respect to their peers\.

__*Interpersonal discrimination harms societies*__

Structural discrimination involving institutions, rules, and norms is not the only attack on people’s digni\- ty\. Discrimination and exclusion among peers, col\- leagues or neighbours or on the streets may also leave psychological scars that last a lifetime if untreated\.

Apart from race and ethnicity people are sometimes discriminated against due to their sexual orienta\- tion or gender identity\. In some countries LGBTQI\+ people have 4\.5 percent stronger symptoms of de\- pression and a 40 percent higher social interaction anxiety rate than their non\-LGBTQI\+ counterparts\.192 When minority statuses overlap—for example, when an LGBTQI\+ person identifies as ethnic minority— the effects of discrimination may multiply, making the person more vulnerable than individuals with a single minority status\.193 LGBTQI\+ young people ap\- pear to be especially vulnerable to discrimination— important, given their delicate stage of development and identity formation\. Some national surveys on this minority group have found that:

- More than 75 percent of LGBTQI\+ young people report having experienced discrimination based on their sexual orientation or gender identity\.
- More than half of transgender and nonbinary young people have seriously considered suicide within the past year, 71 percent experienced symp\- toms of anxiety disorder and roughly 62 percent have had major depressive disorder\.194
- Almost all survey participants \(95 percent\) report difficulty sleeping at night, and 70 percent had felt worthless or hopeless during the past week\.
- Only 26 percent of participants feel safe at school\.195 The two major mental disorders are also more common among LGBTQI\+ young people, though there is no significant variance between different eth\-

nic identities \(figure 2\.8\)\.196

Mental distress caused by exclusion, disrespect and discrimination is one more factor that can increase multidimensional inequalities within societies

“

Mental distress caused by exclusion, disrespect and discrimination is one more factor that can in\- crease multidimensional inequalities within socie\- ties\. Where discrimination does not directly increase health disparities, the mechanism runs through men\- tal distress, which ultimately impairs physical health, hindering people from developing their full potential and living lives they have reason to value\. These dis\- advantaged people then have different conversion factors from their peers—and thus different capabili\- ty sets \(freedom to achieve\)—which further increases

multidimensional inequalities\. In some cases this will further exacerbate discrimination, exclusion and dis\- respect because victims are often blamed for their dis\- advantaged condition in meritocratic societies\.197 It is up to us to stand up against discrimination, protect each other mutually in socially cohesive societies and exercise agency when it comes to resilience building\.

Human development in uncertain times

This chapter shows how mental stressors do not act in a vacuum; they are interconnected and may reinforce each other,198 particularly in the context of uncertain\- ty described in chapter 1\. At the same time multiple systemic factors can help build resilience,199 as ex\- plored in part II of the Report\. Different sources of toxic stress affect not only people’s mental wellbeing but also their physical health, especially at an early stage of the lifecycle, given that body and brain are still developing\. Child, youth and even foetal devel\- opment are functions of socioeconomic, political and

social structures, among many others, all of which determine the level of adversities and distress people are exposed to\. So, individual conversion factors— meaning each individual’s ability to convert resourc\- es into capabilities \(freedom to achieve\) and later into functionings \(achievements\)—will vary between peo\- ple and throughout the lifecycle\. The intergeneration\- al effect of this mechanism is remarkable due to the strong impact of toxic stress and adversities during pregnancy and early childhood\. Mental distress can also affect the capability set of adults, as several ex\- amples throughout the chapter show\. In both cases the expansion of capabilities will be hindered, restraining people’s choices to live lives they have reason to value\. Mental distress can thus shape individuals’ levels of human development as well as the aggregate level of human development of countries and regions, with consequences for inequality within and between countries and regions \(figure 2\.9\)\.

##### Measuring mental wellbeing—an ongoing effort

Measuring mental wellbeing is challenging because the concept is much wider than the mere absence of mental disorders\.1 Not all people who suffer from mental distress develop mental disorders, and many people do not seek professional help due to stigma or a lack of access to mental health services \(including for lack of insurance coverage\)\. They may thus not identify their condition as a mental disorder\.2 Hence, numbers that count these disorders are underesti\- mated\. Moreover, mental wellbeing is neither binary nor constant throughout the lifecycle\. It is a complex continuum that can comprise all sorts of stages, from ideal wellbeing to severe emotional pain, disorienta\- tion and suffering\.3

Not enough is done to enhance mental wellbeing and provide help for people who go through phases

of mental distress\. On average, countries spend less than 2 percent of their healthcare budget on mental health\.4 Due to a lack of resources, inaccurate as\- sessments and shortage of trained medical staff and healthcare providers, only about 10 percent of people worldwide who need mental health interventions re\- ceive them\.5

Even with partial and incomplete information on the extent of mental disorders, the evidence shows that they place a massive burden on every aspect of human livelihoods— on relationships, educa\- tion, work and community participation\.6 Before the Covid\-19 pandemic one person in eight world\- wide, or 970 million people, suffered from a men\- tal health disorder, more women than men\.7 And more than 700,000 people die by suicide each year,

__Note: __Anxiety disorders incorporate disability caused by experiences of intense fear and distress in combination with other physiological symptoms\. Depressive disorders include disability from major depressive disorder and dysthymia; major depressive disorder involves the experience of de\- pressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure almost all day, every day, for two weeks, and dysthymia symptoms are less severe but chronic\. Idiopathic developmental intellectual disability captures the health loss resulting from intellectual disability that arises from any unknown source\. Attention\- deficit/hyperactivity disorder is an externalizing disorder, incorporating disability from persistent inattention and/or hyperactivity/impulsivity\. Conduct disorder occurs in those under age 18 and incorporates disability from antisocial behaviour that violates basic rights of others or major age\-appro\- priate societal norms\. Bipolar disorder is a mood disorder incorporating disability from manic, hypomanic or major depressive episodes \(IHME 2021\)\. __Source: __Human Development Report Office calculations using data from IHME \(2021\)\.

predominantly in low\- and middle\-income countries, accounting for 1 in 100 deaths globally \(the second leading cause of death among those ages 15–29\)\. But for every death by suicide there are at least 20 more attempts, an expression of severe human suffering\.8 Although more men than women die by suicide, more women attempt suicide\.9

Mental health problems are also the single lead\- ing cause of disability worldwide\.10 Children, ado\- lescents and older people are most affected\. WHO estimates that, globally, approximately 20 percent of children and adolescents11 and about 15 percent of people age 60 and older suffer from mental dis\- orders\.12 The most common mental disorders are anxiety \(affecting 300 million people worldwide\)

and depression \(affecting 280 million people; figure S2\.1\.1\)\.13 Most of these people live with their condi\- tion without ever receiving treatment\.14 Much more work is needed to statistically embrace the concept of mental wellbeing, develop adequate measurements for it and offer universal services to enhance it\.

The cause of diagnosed mental disorders varies with context and evolves over time, interacting with several factors, from genes to the environment\. Only about 26 percent of the variation in anxiety15 and 37 percent of the variation in depression is due to var\- iation in genes \(heritability\)\.16 For other mental dis\- orders the proportion can be higher\.17 This chapter focuses on the effects of distress on mental wellbeing for which nonheritable factors are most relevant\.

##### Post\-traumatic stress disorder—not just from combat

Post\-traumatic stress disorder \(PTSD\) has become known mostly as a psychological condition common among war veterans who have returned from combat and been severely traumatized by their experiences on the battlefield\. Less known is that PTSD is com\- mon among the general population, caused by child abuse, domestic violence, life\-threatening accidents, political violence, human rights violations and disas\- ters associated with natural hazards\.

Trauma is “a direct personal experience of an event that involves actual or threatened death or serious

injury, or other threat to one’s physical integrity; or witnessing an event that involves death, injury, or a threat to the physical integrity of another person; or learning about unexpected or violent death, serious harm, or threat of death or injury experienced by a family member or other close associate\.”1

A wide range of symptoms can develop \(table S2\.2\.1\)\. As every human being and each traumatic event differs, strength, duration and types of symp\- toms vary among survivors\. Initially, traumatic ex\- periences trigger the “fight or flight” response in

__Table S2\.2\.1 Symptoms of post\-traumatic stress disorder among adults and children__

__Symptoms among adults	Symptoms among children__

→ Avoidance of thoughts, feelings or conversations associated with the event as well as of people, places or activities that may trigger recollections of the event

→ Trauma\-related thoughts or feelings \(such as fear, horror, anger, guilt or shame\)

→ Intrusion: Recurrent, involuntary and intrusive recollections

→ Dissociative reactions

→ Inability to remember an important aspect of the event \(not due to head injury, alcohol or drugs\)—usually caused by dissociative amnesia

→ Persistent and exaggerated negative beliefs

→ Persistent inability to experience positive emotions

→ Diminished interest or participation in activities

→ All summarized as depression

→ Persistent, distorted cognitions about the cause or consequences of the event and possible blame on self or others

→ Feelings of detachment or estrangement from others

→ Irritable or aggressive behaviour and angry outbursts

→ Reckless or self\-destructive behaviour

→ Hypervigilance

→ Exaggerated startle response

→ Concentration problems

→ Sleep disturbance \(traumatic nightmares\)

→ Affect dysregulation

→ Aggression against self and others

→ Unmodulated aggression and impulse control

→ Dissociative symptoms \(numbing, splitting, fragmentation\)

→ Depression

→ Separation anxiety disorder

→ Oppositional defiant disorder

→ Phobic disorders

→ Disturbed attachment patterns

→ Rapid behavioural regressions and shifts in emotional states

→ Loss of autonomous strivings

→ Failure to achieve developmental competencies

→ Altered schemas of the world

→ Anticipatory behaviour and traumatic expectations

→ Chronic feelings of ineffectiveness

→ Impaired memory

→ Diminished concentration

→ Visceral dysregulation and muscular contraction

→ Anxiety

→ Somatization \(for example, gastrointestinal distress, migraines, chronic back conditions\)

→ Attentional and dissociative problems

→ Difficulty negotiating relationships with caregivers, peers and, subsequently, intimate partners

→ Chronic inflammation

→ Type 2 diabetes

→ Obesity

→ Especially with sexual assault:

- Substance abuse
- Borderline and antisocial personality
- 	Eating, dissociative, affective, somatoform, cardiovascular, metabolic, immunological and sexual disorders
- The loss of bodily regulation in the areas of sleep, food and self\-care
- The apparent lack of awareness of danger and resulting self\- endangering behaviours
- Self\-hatred and self\-blame

the body\. When this biological response is not pro\- cessed, as through rapid eye movement sleep or therapy, it remains activated in later life, when it is no longer necessary or useful\. Trauma survivors then remain hypervigilant, with startling responses long after the traumatic event\.2 They may also de\- velop depression—persistent and exaggerated nega\- tive beliefs about themselves, others and the world, combined with an inability to experience positive feelings and a loss of interest in activities important before the trauma\. Depressed individuals may feel detached or estranged from others with an increas\- ing feeling of isolation, exacerbating the negative worldview\.3

Some individuals tend to avoid thoughts or emo\- tions related to the traumatic event, whereas others experience especially strong emotions or thoughts re\- lated to the trauma\. The disproportional significance of the trauma can impede focus on other aspects of life\. Some thoughts can be intrusive, leading to in\- voluntary recollections of memory that had been lost due to fragmentation or \(partial\) amnesia\.4 Other consequences may include concentration problems,

sleep disturbances,5 or aggressive, reckless or self\-de\- structive behaviour\.6

Early childhood trauma is a special case in which the impact on daily life goes beyond the symptoms of regular PTSD\.7 Even after children are removed from the traumatizing setting, problems with self\-regula\- tion, emotional adaptability, relating to others and self\-understanding may continue throughout life\.8 And post\-traumatic stress in early childhood is asso\- ciated with obesity, chronic inflammation and type 2 diabetes\.9 Chronic dissociation and partial amne\- sia are two common symptoms of early childhood trauma that can affect brain functioning and devel\- opment with long\-lasting consequences\.10 Chronic dissociation detaches real\-life situations from emo\- tions, suppressing natural responses \(such as crying when something sad happens\), which are important for mental wellbeing\. Difficulty with recalling mem\- ories from one’s childhood may lead to distorted identity formation when it is unclear what happened where, when or why during certain stages of one’s life, and it may cause self\-doubt when feeling unable to rely on one’s own mind and memory\.

# Harnessing human development

to navigate uncertain times

PART I — UNCERTAIN TIMES, UNSETTLED LIVES 

<a id="_bookmark61"></a>__CHAPTER 3__

Harnessing human development to navigate uncertain times

There is promise and peril in uncertainty\. Tipping the scales towards promise is up to us\.

But how do we do this?

This chapter doubles down on human development writ large\. Wellbeing achievements matter, but more is needed to expand people’s agency and freedoms to help us navigate and flourish in uncertain times\.

This chapter also argues for widening the vista on human behaviour, going beyond models of rational self\-interest to include emotions, cognitive biases and the critical roles of culture\.

100	HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2021/2022 

<a id="_bookmark62"></a>Enhancing human development in uncertain times: The end, but also the means, to navigate uncertainty

Being sensitive to what is happening in the world today implies taking notice of a novel uncertainty complex that is unsettling people’s lives, as chapters 1 and 2 doc\- umented\. But uncertainty, engendering the possibility of change, can also mobilize action and be a source of hope\. It is not that more unpredictability is better—but that the glaring, and often increasing, injustices pre\- vailing today call for change\. So does the imperative to ease planetary pressures\. They both call for transfor\- mation, as does the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable De\- velopment, subtitled “Transforming Our World\.”

Transformation is an opportunity to shape a world that is more just for people living today and in the future—by addressing behavioural inadequacies and institutional and policy gaps\.1 So how are the defi\- ciencies to be addressed?2 Behavioural change and institutional and policy reform are mutually interde\- pendent: institutional choices and their effectiveness in shaping better outcomes are contingent on behav\- iours and on varying social, economic, political and cultural circumstances\.3 The interaction of behav\- iours and institutions is shaped by public reasoning and procedures of social choice \(figure 3\.1\)\.4 Given that outcomes are contingent on behaviour and cir\- cumstances, how can social choice be shaped so that it advances a transformation to a more just world while easing planetary pressures?

This is where doubling down on human develop\- ment comes in\. Advancing human development, the

aspiration behind every Human Development Re\- port, is not only the end but also the means for peo\- ple to strive for change that leads to better outcomes by harnessing diverse and plural views in productive ways\. Human development is about expanding capa\- bilities, so equitably expanding capabilities is central in assessing development progress and evaluating policies\.5

Capabilities are not exhausted with wellbeing achievements\. One key distinction relates to the dif\- ference between advancing a person’s wellbeing and promoting a person’s agency \(spotlight 3\.1; see also spotlight 3\.2\)\.

Doubling down on human development \(wellbeing and agency\) opens the space to explore options to shape our future\. Many institutions are designed and policies implemented based on specific behavioural assumptions \(that people are rational only if they pur\- sue the maximization of their individual wellbeing while assuming that everyone else is doing the same\)\. But it is possible to draw on a richer understanding of human behaviour and motivation\.6 Central to the human development approach is the emphasis on people’s ability to participate individually and collec\- tively in public reasoning—subjecting prevalent be\- liefs and purported reasons to critical examination and retaining those to be sustained after doing so\.

The pursuit of human development recognizes that people have plural identities and affiliations and value a plurality of dimensions, often simultaneously\. Broadening the vista of how people behave, briefly re\- viewed below, suggests how an approach centred on the pursuit of human development may be the means to navigate uncertainty\. Human development lever\- ages a richer understanding of how people behave as well as the potential for social choice, through indi\- vidual and public scrutiny of beliefs and reasons, to marshal institutions and public policies that advance justice while easing planetary pressures\. How to do so in practice is the subject of part II of the Report\.

Widening the vista of human behaviour

Many institutional designs and policy recommen\- dations assume that people behave as “rational”7 agents \(see spotlight 3\.3\)\. Much can be accomplished by using this assumption to descriptively under\- stand many social and economic processes and to

<a id="_bookmark63"></a>normatively clarify the implications of different so\- cial choices \(column 1 in table 3\.1\)\. But descriptively, this assumption corresponds to a very limited way of representing how people make choices\. For instance, it poses very high demands on people’s cognitive processing power, which has long motivated alter\- native framings of bounded rationality\.8 It also corre\- sponds to a very narrow understanding of the role of the social context,9 which has motivated arguments specifying how social embeddedness matters\.10 The explosion of behavioural economics and behaviour\- al science has documented many deviations in ac\- tual human behaviour from what this assumption would predict\.11 The role of emotions, and how peo\- ple come to reach and stick to beliefs, has also been increasingly explored\. This has provided a broader framework for understanding human behaviour and why it sometimes seems hard for people to act indi\- vidually and collectively in the face of uncertainty\. This broader understanding widens the set of justi\- fications and inspiration for policies and institutions \(column 2 in table 3\.1\)\.

The human development approach’s considera\- tion of agency alongside wellbeing highlights the relevance of expanding beyond the assumption that choices are driven exclusively by the pursuit of the welfare of individuals, interest groups or countries— recognizing that this pursuit does matter and often dominates\.12 But it need not be the exclusive driv\- er of choice\. Amartya Sen described people who are assumed to always exclusively pursue egoistically

individual payoffs while assuming that everyone else is doing the same as “rational fools,”13 because mu\- tual choices based on this assumption often lead to suboptimal outcomes for all involved\.14 He argued further that elements such as the choice process \(in\- cluding the menu of available options to choose from\) and the fact that choices may have to be made even if a judgment has not been fully completed also point to a richer set of determinants of choice than maximiz\- ing individual material interests\. That opens space for “the sociological exploration of the complex val\- ues that influence people’s conduct\.”15

Recent evidence from cognitive neuroscience nu\- ances the commonly held view that what people value is simply what gives them happiness, rewards or pleasantness\. People can value something because of the goals they are pursuing, and these goals \(and therefore, what they value\) can change with circum\- stances \(for example, a compass is more important than a diamond for someone lost in the desert\)\. This goal\-dependent usefulness is critical in guiding be\- haviour and constructing value—and is particularly important when circumstances change\.16 But what people value is not only associated with need; it can also be the result of notions of responsibility\.17 The notion of responsibility could be influenced by so\- cial norms of conduct or individual ethical reflection but takes us to the realm of agency\. In particular, Sen argued that responsibility could be crucial in what he called the “operation of ‘environmental values,’ which is one of the reasons why the market analogy

<a id="_bookmark64"></a>is often quite deceptive in assessing ‘existence values’ of what people try actively to preserve in nature\.”18

People tend to make choices under what is called narrow framing\. That is, they do not evaluate all possible outcomes and weigh them against one another but focus on one or a few that are more salient for different reasons

“

The insights briefly reviewed here are not new, but today’s uncertain times make them more relevant— and may, in fact, call for completely new analytical tools \(spotlight 3\.4; see also spotlight 3\.5\)\. Going be\- yond the “rational” agent and the behavioural agent and recognizing the role of the broader social con\- text in shaping people’s choices gets us to the encul\- tured agent \(column 3 in table 3\.1\)\.19 This provides an even wider scope of interventions, one that includes a more prominent account of the role of the social context and the potential of widening ways of inter\- vening to confront today’s uncertain times\. In build\- ing this argument, the chapter explains the relevance of the human development approach to seize that potential\.

A psychologically richer description of behaviour under uncertainty

One example where the deviations of the rational choice model matters for the analysis in this Report relates to how people make choices under uncertain\- ty\. In many cases choices appear to be based on the evaluation of changes in wellbeing from a certain ref\- erence point,20 as opposed to being based on the eval\- uation of levels of wellbeing\.21 There might be a deep biological and cognitive foundation for this,22 given that human perceptual systems are broadly adaptive: what we find cold or hot or bright or dark is driven in part by a contrast with a frame of reference, typically our recent experience with temperature or light\.23

People often seem to give greater weight to loss\- es than gains when making choices\. That is, they are often more reluctant to choose an outcome where there is a chance of losing $100 than one where there is the same chance of gaining the same amount—loss aversion\.24 This can account for the status quo bias,25 or the endowment effect, where people ask for more

compensation to sell something they already own than what they would be willing to pay if they did not own it yet—a rational agent would have no reason to value the same thing differently\.26 A related behav\- iour is probability weighting, where people attribute a higher probability to events that have actually very low probability of occurring \(say, winning the lottery\), while assuming that events with very high probability of occurring are less likely than they are in reality\.27

Something that sociologists have emphasized for a long time is that people often look at money as some\- thing other than a fungible and homogeneous flow of income\. In many cases they construct mental ac\- counts attributing different meanings and values to different flows of income depending on factors rang\- ing from how the money was earned to what it was meant for\.28 Money also serves different functions, from offering for a sense of autonomy to being val\- ued for the security that it provides for the future, which can vary across cultural contexts and across the income distribution\.29 Finally—and the list could go on even for this narrow set of behaviours linked to choice under uncertainty—people tend to make choices under what is called narrow framing\.30 That is, they do not evaluate all possible outcomes and weigh them against one another but focus on one or a few that are more salient for different reasons \(be\- cause they are surprising, say\)\.31

To illustrate how this set of deviations from the rational choice model can matter in the context of changes to address the challenges discussed in this Report, imagine the following scenario\. A policy\- maker shows how existing fossil fuel subsidies are inefficient and regressive, are polluting the air and could be phased out and replaced by income trans\- fers or public spending on health and education, at the same time giving incentives for less energy\-in\- tensive investments and innovations that help to fight climate change\.32

How would a behavioural agent look at the pro\- posal? Possible deviations from rational choice \(in\- terlinked, not necessarily sequential and separate\) include the following\. First, the subsidy becomes sali\- ent \(the agent might not even have known before that something like this was in place\) and a primary focus of valuation \(narrow framing\)\. Second, the endow\- ment effect would suggest that the behavioural agent is not inclined to simply accept losing something she

<a id="_bookmark65"></a>already has\. Third, as appealing as the potential gains from the policy are to the climate change–aware be\- havioural agent, loss aversion can dominate, and the prospective gains might not compensate for the pro\- spective losses\.33 Fourth, mental accounts mean that all the money may already be destined for purposes and goals from which the agent will not want to de\- viate\. Fifth, even though the policymaker is of unim\- peachable integrity and very likely to follow through with the compensation scheme, probability weight\- ing could come to the fore, leading the behavioural agent to believe that it is not that likely\.

Now widely recognized and accepted, cognitive biases have opened a much richer understanding of human behaviour and a wider scope for the range of

“

policies and institutions that may be considered beyond those that emanate from the rational choice model

At a minimum the behavioural agent could be ex\- pected to be less supportive, if not outright oppose, phasing out the fossil fuel subsidy, independent of political economy and framing effects\. In reali\- ty, powerful economic interests seek to sway pub\- lic opinion against removing fossil fuel subsidies to keep their economic and political power,34 possibly crafting narratives that build on some of these be\- havioural insights\. The scenario does not imply that the behavioural agent is beyond the reach of reason: each of the steps could be critically scrutinized, even if this could be complex and cognitively demanding\. Nor is it inevitable that everyone will oppose the re\- moval of fossil fuel subsidies—quite the contrary, as the discussion below suggests\. This scenario is meant simply to illustrate how a psychologically richer de\- scription of behaviour under uncertainty opens space to consider a wider scope beyond material incentives to shape people’s choices\.35

Now widely recognized and accepted, cognitive biases \(with reference to what would be expected behaviour as a “rational” agent\) and cognitive lim\- itations \(people are unable to process as much in\- formation as would need to happen under a rational choice model\) have opened a much richer under\- standing of human behaviour\. This understanding can widen the range of policies and institutions that

may be considered beyond those that emanate from the rational choice model\. The implications contin\- ue to be explored in fields ranging from optimal tax\- ation36 to issues that draw on progress in behavioural economics as an example of the “golden age of social science\.”37 Prospect theory \(which accounts for sever\- al of the biases associated with behaviour under un\- certainty\)38 has been used for insights from politics39 to international relations\.40 This has inspired policy interest in “nudging” or “priming” interventions that preserve the freedom of choice but change the choice architecture in ways that seek to “correct” for cogni\- tive biases\.41 These nonfiscal and nonregulatory ac\- tions steer people to behave in a certain way but fully preserve freedom of choice\. One example is the Save More Tomorrow initiative, behavioural interventions nudging people to save more, whose principles have been incorporated in the United States’ 2006 Pen\- sion Protection Act\.42

No single unified model accounts for all the docu\- mented cognitive biases\.43 So an intervention seek\- ing to address one type of bias may affect behaviour in a negative way elsewhere\.44 Some behavioural in\- terventions can even become too salient and back\- fire, such as displaying death counts in street signs to encourage safer driving, which has been shown to increase car crashes\.45 Nudges aim at intervening in situations where people think fast and automatically, implying that they make decisions in a different way from when they are able to think slowly and reflec\- tively\.46 But this dichotomy may imply that opportu\- nities are missed by recognizing that it is possible to incorporate elements of reflection even in nudges47 or to boost people’s ability to make decisions, enhanc\- ing their agency in making choices\.48 The effective\- ness of nudges and boosts may also vary depending on the cultural context\.49

More than reviewing all relevant biases and their implications, the purpose here is to suggest that cog\- nitive biases and limitations often shape how people behave, particularly in contexts of uncertainty\. But that behaviour, even if it deviates from what the ra\- tional choice model predicts, does not imply that peo\- ple are lacking in reason—much of the behaviour may actually be preferable, particularly to deal with un\- certainty\.50 Thus, awareness of these considerations has heightened relevance when confronting uncer\- tainties\. A promising development with potentially

<a id="_bookmark66"></a>far\-reaching policy implications is identifying funda\- mental cognitive processes that can account for many of the observed behavioural choices under uncertain\- ty \(spotlight 3\.6\)\.

When emotions make preferences fickle

The emotion of fear—triggered by the belief of a threat—tends to make people more risk averse, while anger tends to make them more risk seeking\.51 This is just an example of how beliefs can change prefer\- ences through emotions\.52 Rational choice theory assumes not only that beliefs and preferences both matter but also that they are delinked\. Emotions re\- sult from gathering information, learning and ex\- perience\.53 Thinking and feeling are simultaneous processes that cognitively shape an individual’s per\- ception, attention, learning, memory, reasoning and problem solving—affecting even the direction of cog\- nitive biases\. For instance, sadness—growing glob\- ally over the last decade, with more intensity among the less educated— often reverses the endowment effect: when people are sad, choice prices exceed selling prices \(figure 3\.2\)\.54 Sadness can also height\- en addictive substance use\.55 In addition, anger can account for major changes in political history that

rational choice alone cannot explain,56 and emotions more broadly can be decisive in accounts of historical action and thought\.57 Hope can lead to choices that enhance health58 and mediate the relation between income and subjective measures of wellbeing\.59

The relevance of emotions seems to have deep neuro\-anatomical foundations, as seen in the way people with different types of brain injuries make de\- cisions\.60 Recent neuroscience findings suggest that rational decisionmaking may depend on prior accu\- rate emotional processing\.61 Even though some of the specific findings may not be conclusive,62 a growing body of evidence documents multiple ways that emo\- tions matter when making choices,63 generating “the rise of affectivism\.”64 A full emotion\-imbued model of choice has been proposed\.65

An instinctive sentiment of anger that can trig\- ger a risky course of action—which, in insight and after critical reasoning is seen as harmful to oneself or others—can be dangerous\. By contrast, emotions are often triggered by reasoned understanding of connections—for instance, the cause of manifest in\- justice that makes one angry about discrimination or torture\. Angry rhetoric in the writings of Mary Woll\- stonecraft in the 19th century against the inequalities suffered by women was followed by a strong appeal to reason for the equality of rights of all human beings\.66

<a id="_bookmark67"></a>That emotions matter for behaviour is not, however, a negation of rationality or reason or a justification for not subjecting emotions to reasoned appraisal in the same way that motivations and beliefs need to be\.

Motivated beliefs and motivated reasoning: When more and better information may not be enough

Preferences, goals and motivations can directly affect beliefs, as a rapidly growing literature on motivated beliefs and motivated reasoning documents—people distort how they process new information in the di\- rection of beliefs they favour\.67 In rational choice, be\- liefs are based on rationally processing information, and people cannot be systematically fooled\. But be\- liefs also fulfil psychological and other needs, with implications for behaviour and choice\.

One example of motivated reasoning is wishful thinking, which seems to have a positive valence value, making people feel better and more optimistic about the world, thus also having an emotional com\- ponent\. But it also has a functional value, allowing people to persist in a task under adversity\.68 Howev\- er, it may also support dangerous behaviours, such as persisting in smoking, believing that one’s health will not be affected, despite all the scientific evidence to the contrary\.69

Beliefs about oneself or the world can persist de\- spite information that would suggest \(in a rational choice model\) the need to update beliefs\. Such per\- sistence can take place through many mechanisms of self\-deception or dissonance reduction\.70 The pro\- pensity to rationalize away evidence that clashes with beliefs has been documented to be higher in some instances for more analytically sophisticated and bet\- ter educated individuals, so one cannot assume that the importance of motivated cognition will decrease as levels of education increase\.71 Evidence also sug\- gests that motivated reasoning is persistent in politi\- cal leaders, who rely more on prior political attitudes and less on new policy information than the general public\.72

Challenging beliefs that are deeply held be\- cause they are associated with a person’s goals or commitments—for example, religious, moral or a salient aspect of a person’s identity or politics—can trigger strong emotional responses of anger or even

hate and disgust\.73 Motivated reasoning can lead to beliefs becoming more polarized around issues such as immigration, income mobility and how to handle crime\.74 That is, some of the cleavages in beliefs are tied not necessarily to material interests but to differ\- ent worldviews or social identity\. And when these ac\- quire more salience, polarization can become more correlated across issues, leading to “belief\-value constellations,”75 where people associate more with a group based on shared ideas rather than economic interests\.76

Recognizing motivated beliefs can provide a broader understanding not only of economic choices but also of social and political dynamics that cannot be accounted for by assuming that voters and pressure groups pursue their material self\-interest and update their beliefs on the basis of new evidence

“

One illustration of the potential implications of motivated reasoning is associated with \(epistemic\) norms that shape what people consider to be true, in addition to individual reasoning\.77 Children at very young age \(age 4, with some rudimentary aspects emerging during infancy\) can determine beliefs that are the norm in their context and identify false beliefs

—according to the prevailing social norm\.78 Different groups may assume different epistemic norms that place different levels of trust on different sources of information, institutions, experts and leaders\. Indi\- viduals may publicly reject or avoid certain behav\- iours \(for instance, attitudes towards vaccines or the use of masks to avoid the spread of Covid\-19\)79 to sig\- nal their commitment to a particular group and the belief\-value constellation that it holds\.80 This may “create a tension between epistemic norms that reli\- ably lead to true beliefs and those that effectively per\- form \[…\] signaling functions associated with social identity and group membership\.”81

Thus, recognizing motivated beliefs can provide a broader understanding not only of economic choices but also of social and political dynamics that cannot be accounted for by assuming that voters and pres\- sure groups pursue their material self\-interest and update their beliefs on the basis of new evidence\.82 Another very compelling application of motivated be\- liefs could be how people may convince themselves

<a id="_bookmark68"></a>that climate change is not going to be too bad purely because it helps them justify not taking action\.83 Un\- derstanding motivated reasoning provides a lens to understand some dynamics of polarization noted in chapter 1 and explored further in part II of the Re\- port\. How goals and values can motivate beliefs may be relevant when we confront novel uncertainties and particularly when there is a reversal in the impor\- tance given in public debate to sentiments rather than reasons\. Since the 1980s there has been a reversal in a trend dating from the mid\-19th century of rational language dominating sentiment\-laden language in fact\-based argument \(figure 3\.3\)\.84

This evidence does not suggest that beliefs are never or even infrequently updated based on new in\- formation\. But it shows how motivated cognition can provide a richer understanding of human behaviour\.85 It also shows that polarization should not be seen as inevitable and preordained—and that the affirma\- tion of a more salient social identity, above all others, should not be seen to uniquely define a person and thus be accepted without scrutiny\.86 Even more im\- portant from a human development perspective, indi\- vidual reasoning and public deliberation are powerful drivers of social change—people are not helpless pris\- oners of one single social identity, of their emotions

<a id="_bookmark69"></a>or of motivated beliefs\. Indeed, harnessing diversity of goals, motivations, values, beliefs and emotions depends on how behaviours interact with institutions and the procedures of social choice that can harness plurality in productive ways, as explored next\.

Behavioural and institutional change: Mobilizing human development towards a hopeful future

As argued earlier, behavioural changes and institu\- tional reforms are interdependent\. And the richer understanding of human behaviour just reviewed suggests much more scope for change in both than may be commonly assumed\. This is central to explore how to draw from a context of uncertainty to mobilize action towards a more hopeful future\. That scope ex\- pands even further with the understanding that cog\- nitive biases and limitations are not hardwired and universal to all humans in the same way87—and are not necessarily an inherent part of our psychology\.88 Similarly, the role of emotions in changing preferenc\- es and driving behaviour is also context contingent\. Emotions play a role in people’s conforming with so\- cial norms, but the salience of doing so to avoid either shame or guilt depends on the cultural context\.89 It has been argued that socialization and cultural con\- text determine which emotions matter for behaviour and how\.90 And preferences and the motivations that may drive certain beliefs—across domains, from at\- titudes towards risk to preferences for equity and in\- come distribution—vary widely across individuals and across countries\.91

Bringing culture back in: How the social context matters

Recognizing culture \(discussed below\) is only part of a broader and more fundamental point: the need to give greater salience to how social contexts shape preferences, perceptions and cognition—not only what people do but also who people believe they are\. That takes us from the rational agent and beyond the behavioural agent to the encultured agent \(see table 3\.1\)\.92 Recent insights from sociology have recon\- ceptualized culture from something that stays in the background of political and economic life towards a much more dynamic, fluid and adaptable toolkit\.

This implies a two\-way causal effect between cul\- ture and institutions\.93 It also means that people se\- lect strategically from the toolkit to provide meaning, interpretation and justification for their behaviour\.94 Studies of poverty that focus on how scarcity taxes people’s cognitive capacities and functions95 would benefit from considering how people perceive and identify needs based on what they take from the cul\- tural toolkit available to them\.96 When uncertainty becomes salient, different groups of young people buffer themselves against a murky future in differ\- ent ways, drawing on the cultural toolkits available to them\.97 This perspective on culture is inspiring fresh takes on economic development, exploring how highly adaptable and fluid cultural configurations in\- teract with political power and economic incentives to generate different social, economic and political outcomes\.98

An emerging account of how cultural variation takes hold comes from the field of cultural evolution,99 even if it remains a hotly debated perspective\.100 In this account psychological traits coevolve with the broader cultural context in combinations that make societies better adapted to different circumstanc\- es over time\.101 These perspectives also suggest that what is assumed to be universal human behaviour is often based on what is observed from a sliver of hu\- manity\.102 Thus, there is a much broader diversity of behaviours, psychology and institutions across the world and over time\. And there is even more variation within than across cultures\.103

Recognizing culture is only part of a broader and more fundamental point: the need to give greater salience to how social contexts shape preferences, perceptions and cognition—not only what people do but also who people believe they are

“

Culture, in these accounts, “represents informa\- tion stored in people’s heads that got there through cultural learning or direct experience induced by various cultural products, like norms, technologies, languages or institutions\.”104 Cultures can vary in sys\- tematic ways on dimensions ranging from how tight cultural norms are enforced105 to how individualistic they are\.106 But cultures cannot be firmly categorized in different boxes—and even less so in dichotomous

<a id="_bookmark70"></a>ways, such as associating individualistic cultures with “the West” and interdependent cultures with “the East\.”107

In cultural evolution accounts, cultural change is driven largely by the emergence of culture and psy\- chological traits that are better adapted to cope with the new environment\.108 Over time this has resulted in culture\-psychology combinations that have ena\- bled people to cooperate at larger scales—millions of strangers in today’s societies—devising specific social arrangements \(institutions, policies\) resulting in ever more complex and sophisticated technologies, lead\- ing to higher income and material wellbeing\.109 Cul\- tural evolution is one way of accounting for changes in moral values, with variations around the world as\- sociated in part with how different societies have re\- sponded to the problem of cooperation\.110

A mismatch of behavioural patterns and institutional settings in today’s uncertain times?

Culture is both persistent, which helps people nav\- igate and make decisions in their social world, and changeable, particularly when that social world or the environment around it is altered\.111 When uncertainty is heightened or changes, the potential for a cultural mismatch increases between those relying on pre\- vailing culture and those attempting to innovate to adapt to the new circumstances\.112 Cultural change can play a role in how the social context influences the emergence of behaviour and institutional config\- urations\. But as Amartya Sen argued: “Paying reflec\- tive ethical attention to behaviour neither nullifies, nor is nullified by, the importance of evolutionary forces\.”113 Ethical reasoning has been described as a powerful way of “escaping from tribalism,” manifest in patterns of moral progress that are less and less ex\- clusionary of groups of people\.114 It also offers oppor\- tunities for norm\-based governance to address global collective action challenges, such as climate change\.115 Evolutionary processes and ethical reasoning may have interacted in reaching the current prevailing configurations of behaviours and institutions\. But today’s uncertain times have novel elements that present fundamentally new challenges, and those configurations may not be a good match\. Some of the challenges of the Anthropocene are existential;

others require cooperation not only with people alive today but also with people who do not yet exist— that is, with the future\.116 The Anthropocene reality of shared challenges at the planetary scale requires cooperation— or, at a minimum, coordination— across countries\.

There is tension between conforming to the prevailing institutions \(including norms\) and behaviours that have moved the world towards record achievements in material wellbeing—and the lack of response from those norms, institutions and behaviours

“

to a novel and unprecedented context

Individual solutions for shared challenges can cre\- ate tensions between self\-reliance and collective effi\- ciency\. One country or group of people may be able to afford to stay protected from a pandemic through pri\- vate means\. That can make cooperation and even co\- ordination more difficult, in a modern tragedy of the commons\.117 Certainty about biophysical thresholds of climate change and other dangerous patterns of planetary change that would spell catastrophe would make coordination by self\-interested agents more likely\. But great uncertainty about those thresholds makes collective action less likely and harder\.118

So, today’s uncertain times may be characterized in part as a mismatch between the cultural configu\- rations that have enabled certain development paths thus far119 and the layered novel uncertainties of the Anthropocene, transitions and polarization\. Disa\- greements and even conflict in societies may reflect that mismatch\. There is tension between conform\- ing to the prevailing institutions \(including norms\) and behaviours that have moved the world towards record achievements in material wellbeing—and the lack of response from those norms, institutions and behaviours to a novel and unprecedented context\.

This mismatch could be playing out in many di\- mensions\. One has to do with generational inequal\- ities in exposure to climate extremes\. For the cohort born in 1960, exposure to lifetime heat waves is es\- sentially the same across climate change scenari\- os\. But even if temperatures stay below 1\.5°C above preindustrial levels, the cohort born in 2020 will suffer four times more exposure—and seven times more under current pledges \(figure 3\.4\)\. No surprise,

then, that young people ages 16–25 around the world report associating climate change with a range of emotions with negative affect, from anger to anxie\- ty: two\-thirds report feeling sad, and two\-thirds re\- port feeling afraid\.120 Another facet of disagreement is the differences across groups of people in either doubting or denying climate change\. Groups in Eu\- rope more concerned about their economic security

of decision influences choices, one of the insights of behavioural science, and the role of emotions and motivated reasoning widens the scope beyond incen\- tives shaping the choices of self\-interested agents\. But recognizing the role of culture further widens the scope\. It takes us beyond considering how interests and institutions drive people’s behaviour, to recog\- nize the power of ideas\.124

Ideas with the power to shape individual and col\- lective choice range from social identities and world\- views125 to narratives and frames\.126 Joel Mokyr has emphasized “cultural entrepreneurs” as agents able to change the beliefs of others during momentous transformations in history, such as during the En\- lightenment and the Industrial Revolution\.127 Car\- oline Schill and colleagues argue that this more “dynamic understanding of human behaviour” is es\- sential in the Anthropocene\.128

This Report extends the argument to today’s un\- certain times\.129 It looks at current disagreements and differences in perspective across groups of peo\- ple less as a motive for despair and more as the kind of diversity and pluralism that may be needed in an open\-ended pursuit of the innovations—social, tech\- nological, institutional—required to respond to novel and unprecedented challenges\. In the “paradox of di\- versity,” this pursuit may require longer lead times to agree on collective actions and implement collective decisions\.130 As David Byrne sings: “The future is cer\- tain; give us time to work it out\.” This paradox gives even more reason to address inequalities perceived as unfair or divisive, while preserving the plurality of views and an open, reasoned, public debate\.131

and less certain about the future are much more like\-		

ly to reject climate change—and to be “less prosper\- ous, more rural and more economically dependent on fossil fuels\.”121 And individualistic attitudes are associated with less concern for environmental ac\- tion122 and less wearing of masks during the Covid\-19 pandemic\.123

The potential of this mismatch, and the broader range of determinants of human behaviour beyond rational and behavioural agents, also opens opportu\- nities to mobilize uncertain times for better individ\- ual and social outcomes\. The insights from rational choice and the emphasis on incentives remain rele\- vant\. Understanding how the context in the moment

Advancing human development to learn, and to expand the scope for learning, in uncertain times

Chapter 1 documented how novel layers of interact\- ing uncertainties are heightening feelings of insecu\- rity,132 pointing to a disconnect between wellbeing achievements and security\. What do we hold on to, then, when even our sense of direction seems sub\- merged in uncertainty? Wellbeing achievements with insecurity and progress with polarization133 cast doubt on seeing development as a smooth process of pro\- gress in wellbeing achievements\. Ideas, institutions and policies seeking to advance development are not

<a id="_bookmark72"></a>delivering as expected, but they are also opening new and dangerous problems by undermining the ecolog\- ical integrity of our biosphere and leaving many peo\- ple behind\.134

Where we go from here is up to us\. Our planet and societies have gone through periods of change and volatility before\. But one key feature making this era unique is humans’ role in driving threats—and our potential ability to shape the changes to build a more hopeful future \(spotlight 3\.7\)\.135 A real paradox of our time is our tentativeness to act despite mounting evi\- dence of the distress that our pursuit of development is inflicting on our societies and planet\. One contri\- bution of this Report is to explore how understanding uncertainty and its relation to individual and collec\- tive choices can explain why action may be delayed, even in the face of looming threats, and to suggest ways forward that move us beyond paralysis\.136

Why might societies not adequately respond to uncertainty? Consider the interaction between the different multilayered uncertainties and both behav\- iour and institutions \(figure 3\.5\)\. Societies respond to shocks through multiple institutional and policy mechanisms\. These institutions are often designed to absorb the shocks and moderate the threats that people confront\. Under the rational choice model this process depends on state capacity, resource distribu\- tion and social preferences, as with the way societies

manage the potential tensions between social insur\- ance and individual responsibility\.137

Now consider how social arrangements \(insti\- tutions and policies\) are influenced by a wider set of individual and social factors interacting with an evolving reality\. In the presence of new threats, peo\- ple’s behaviour is strongly mediated by their per\- ceived uncertainty\.138 This perception comes through different channels\. First is the increase in residual uncertainty, the one not absorbed by the collective response\. Second is the perceived adequacy of the social response and the extent to which previous be\- liefs about how things work hold, which determines confidence in institutions and trust within and across groups\. Third is the social and cultural context that defines the interpretation of the new threats in the light of prevailing narratives\. Is it a sign of personal failure? Will this affect my position and future pros\- pects in society?139 Fourth are the emotions surround\- ing the increased uncertainty, ranging from fear to indifference to hope\. The same shock can thus cause different levels of perceived individual uncertainty, depending on the prevailing narratives about under\- lying processes and the perceived effectiveness of policies\.

Uncertainty for individuals shapes both individu\- al behaviour and attitudes, with an impact on social interactions\. Collective responses to uncertainty that

<a id="_bookmark73"></a>are perceived as ineffective or unfair can trigger an\- imosity and polarization—especially in the presence of political narratives that manipulate the situation to deepen societal divides\.140 Such polarization has been documented in several countries in the response to the Covid\-19 pandemic,141 where the public health measures put in place were resisted less because of a personal assessment of risks of, for instance, being vaccinated, and more because they represented a set of behaviours that defined expected group behav\- iours\. Disbelief in climate change is associated more with political allegiance than with misinformation\.142 This animosity and polarization then drive not only the specific collective response but also how the col\- lective response interacts with the threat, eventually heightening uncertainty\. Thus, the high and in many cases rising perceptions of insecurity may be ac\- counted for in this type of uncertainty loop\.

Expanding human development to foster learning and public reasoning

The broader understanding of human behaviour highlighted in this chapter helps account for some of the choices that so many people are making around the world, resulting in patterns ranging from political polarization to the rejection or dilution of the science of climate change and pandemics\. But understand\- ing does not mean resignation\. Recognizing the role of emotions does not mean that we should wait until catastrophic outcomes become emotionally salient to act\. Events that become salient and emotionally res\- onant can drive action, sometimes in directions that were thought to be unthinkable before that event\.143 But the layers of uncertainty described in chapter 1 imply that we have no option other than to think ahead and act with a sense of urgency, since in many cases we will not have second chances\.144

And understanding that people are often prey to motivated reasoning and hold steadfast to beliefs that are hard to dislodge145 is no reason to not scruti\- nize reasons and beliefs\. Subjecting prevailing beliefs and alleged reasons to critical examination, through appropriately comprehensive processes \(see below\) and with relevant information, can result in objective beliefs\. Indeed, research has shown that uncertain\- ty about other people’s political beliefs and attitudes

can drive people to tighten their own beliefs\.146 Be\- cause people often misconceive others’ attitudes and values, polarization may be cemented in spaces and on issues where differences in attitudes or opinions are, in fact, fairly small\.147 This so\-called “false polar\- ization” has been found to drive actual political po\- larization\.148 Understanding the processes that create misconceptions opens space for interventions that may correct them and mitigate political polarization\.149

Subjecting prevailing beliefs and alleged reasons to critical examination, through appropriately comprehensive processes and with relevant information, can result in objective beliefs

“

This scrutiny of reasons and beliefs should happen at the individual level, but here we have to be mindful also of the cognitive limitations and biases discussed earlier in the chapter \(see also spotlight 3\.6\)\. That is why public reasoning—always important under any circumstances—acquires heightened relevance in to\- day’s world\. Our individual brains are limited, but our collective brain150 is far more powerful\. A plurality of sources of voice and power is not a weakness in to\- day’s uncertain times but can be a source of strength, provided processes sustained by democratic practic\- es ensure that public reasoning takes place in a con\- text and through processes where what carries the day is not always a powerful economic or political group or a highly motivated believer who refuses to subject beliefs to critical examination\.151 Processes of democratic practice, at multiple scales, need to also avoid parochial dominance and welcome perspec\- tives from “impartial spectators”—that is, the views of people who may not be part of a particular political jurisdiction\. And given that the novel layers of uncer\- tainty have planetary relevance, the role of multilat\- eralism becomes more relevant than ever\.152

So what to do? Part II of the Report addresses this question, but as part I closes, it is important to reaf\- firm the central argument of this chapter, that dou\- bling down on human development is not only the central aspiration but also the means to navigate un\- certain times and effect the behavioural changes and institutional reforms that would allow us to shape a more hopeful future\. Advancing human develop\- ment means pursuing all aspects of capabilities, not

<a id="_bookmark74"></a>just the drive to enhance wellbeing achievements\. Agency matters, as do freedoms in both wellbeing and agency— options that need to remain wide as the search for the appropriate set of institutions and behaviours is still open\-ended\. In a sense expand\- ing human development in uncertain times can also be a learning process, where capabilities—wellbeing and agency, achievements and freedoms—allow for changes in behaviour and institutions to take shape in addition to expanding the scope for learning\. Con\- fronting the layers of uncertainty that we face today

is about enhancing cooperation at multiple scales and about the “agility of the mind” to use new and appropriate frames to understand our world and the responses needed to address the challenges that we confront\.153

Part II of the Report proposes motivating princi\- ples whose cultivation can enable public reasoning, as well as priority policy areas, so that human devel\- opment is advanced in a way that enables people to harness uncertainty towards a more hopeful world— more just for people living now and in the future\.

__SPOTLIGHT 3\.1__

##### How agency differs from wellbeing

Agency is the ability to hold values and make com\- mitments that may— or may not—advance the per\- son’s wellbeing\.1 The person may be committed to fighting climate change to an extent that she skips school or forgoes a well\-paying job, choices that may not advance wellbeing but would express agen\- cy\. Another important distinction is between actual achievements and the options or freedoms available to people, regardless of their choices\. Independent of what people end up securing, the options or freedoms available to people are inherently valuable\.2

These distinctions result in four aspects of capabil\- ities of interest:

- Achievements in wellbeing\.
- Achievements in agency\.
- Freedoms in wellbeing\.
- Freedoms in agency\.3

In assessing development progress, the spotlight tends to shine more on wellbeing achievements, such as standards of living, and much less on the freedoms available to people and their agency\.4

But these four aspects of capabilities are relevant in the context of drawing on the human development approach to support behavioural change and insti\- tutional reform to navigate today’s uncertain times\. Chapters 1 and 2 suggest the need to go beyond— not replace— considering wellbeing achievements alone—for two reasons\. First, the spotlight on well\- being achievements may leave other aspects of life that matter to people in the shadows—such as feeling

very or increasingly insecure, despite high wellbeing achievements\. Second, there is no guarantee that fo\- cusing on wellbeing achievements alone would equip people with the capabilities to navigate today’s un\- certain times—and particularly to lead fundamental transformational change to adapt and transition away from the layers of novel uncertainty that characterize today’s world\.

Freedoms and agency have always been intrinsical\- ly important\. They are also instrumentally important, as in facilitating collective action to provide public goods\.5 And they may be indispensable where soci\- eties have to explore largely uncharted transitions to an aspirational space of expanding human develop\- ment while easing planetary pressures\.6

Human development, understood as expanding the four aspects of capabilities, thus becomes both the end and the means\. Agency acquires relevance because it is difficult, if not impossible, to conceive of people leading the required transformations if they are seen only as potential receivers of assistance, as simply “vehicles of wellbeing,”7 as mere patients— rather than as agents able to judge, to commit and to give priority to goals and values that may go beyond advancing their wellbeing\. Recognizing agency af\- firms people not only as the subject of wellbeing\- or welfare\- enhancing policies \(though these are im\- portant\) but also as active promoters and catalysts of social and economic change8—beyond their own nar\- row self\-interest\.

__NOTES __

1. Sen \(1985\) suggested that the neglect of agency is shadowed by the consideration that people are geared exclusively to purse their material self\-interest\.
2. Sen \(1985\) argued that the neglect of options results from assuming that only actual achievements, or what people end up choosing, counts\. See Sen \(1999\) for an elaboration on the perspective of seeing development as freedom\. This refers primarily to what Sen called opportunity freedoms, recognizing that process freedoms, some of which may not be associated with capabilities, also matter\.
3. The original framing around these four categories of capabilities was pro\- posed in Sen \(1985\)\. The discussion here, including the examples, draws mainly from the simplified treatment in Sen \(2009b\)\.
4. These four aspects of capability often reinforce one another but need not\. For instance, being well nourished is certainly something important for human life and part of the wellbeing aspect of capabilities\. But some\- times a commitment to fasting \(for religious or political reasons\), which is in the realm of the agency aspect of capabilities, may override the overwhelming importance that being well\-nourished has for most people, most of the time\. And while the state should have an obligation to ensure

that everyone has the freedom to be well\-nourished, just because the wellbeing achievement of being well\-nourished matters does not imply that the state should ban fasting\. That would be a limitation not only in people’s freedoms in wellbeing achievements, by precluding the pos\- sibility of choosing not to eat, but also in their agency, by excluding the possibility of making a commitment to fasting \(Sen 1985\)\.

##### Agency, ideas and the origins of the regulatory welfare state

__Elisabeth Anderson, __*New York University Abu Dhabi*

Can an individual change the course of policy histo\- ry? Might such individuals be motivated by shared ideas from which they do not stand to directly bene\- fit? The answer to both questions, I argue in my recent book, *Agents of Reform: Child Labor and the Origins of the Welfare State, *is a qualified yes\. Under certain conditions, and only with cooperation from others, individual middle\-class reformers exercised deci\- sive influence over early legislation to protect work\- ers\. Acting on culturally embedded ideas about why industrial labour conditions were problematic, they exercised creative agency to build political coalitions and surmount institutional barriers to change\. At a time when labour still lacked the power to demand protective legislation on its own, these reformers de\- serve much of the credit for bringing the regulatory welfare state into being\.

Regulatory welfare refers to the web of policies that protect workers by limiting employers’ arbitrary power over them\. Child labour laws enacted in the 1830s and 1840s were the first of these efforts to in\- tervene in the relationship between the new industrial bourgeoisie and the “free” labour it employed\. These laws formed the bedrock on which vital protections for adult workers—including occupational health and safety regulations as well as the normal working day— were eventually built\. Still, scholars tend to pay little attention to this regulatory side of the welfare state\. *Agents of Reform *aims to correct this through seven case studies of the political origins of child labour and factory inspection legislation in 19th century Belgium, France, Germany and the United States\.

middle\-class reformers who spearheaded efforts to enact child labour laws and later to create the factory inspection systems needed to enforce them\.

One puzzle is why these reformers bothered to put time and energy into advocating for policies from which they themselves did not stand to directly ben\- efit\. Understanding this requires excavating the ideas that motivated them—and these, it turns out, were surprisingly diverse\. Ideologically, child labour and factory inspection reformers ran the gamut from clas\- sical liberalism to religious conservatism to demo\- cratic socialism\. What united them, however, was the belief that excessive and premature labour inflict\- ed lasting damage on children’s minds, bodies and souls\. Allowing such abuses to continue posed a dire threat, not only to working\-class children’s wellbeing but also to the nation as a whole\. How they interpret\- ed this threat varied\. For instance, some saw child workers as potential criminals or revolutionaries who required the disciplining influence of school, where\- as other regarded them as national resources whose human capital was being squandered\. Ideas such as these informed reformers’ understandings of the child labour problem and drove them to pursue leg\- islation\. They were not, at least not in a direct sense, motivated by simple self\-interest\.

Of course, not all would\-be reformers were equal\- ly influential\. They needed allies\. Scrutinizing how some succeeded while others did not reveals that ef\- fective reformers distinguished themselves in two ways: alliance\-building and problem solving\.

Throughout much of the 19th century, work\-		

ing\-class people were politically marginalized\. In many countries they could not even vote\. Moreo\- ver, many workers did not regard child labour as a problem requiring legislative attention; some de\- pended on their children’s earnings to survive, and others were more focused on issues of direct con\- cern to adult men\. Under these conditions it was

Alliance\-building

Reformers used a variety of alliance\-building strategies—including framing, citation, piggyback\- ing, compromise and expertise\-signalling—in ways that accorded with the priorities and expectations of the audiences they needed to convince\. Take the

first of these strategies: frames are ideas that political actors deploy to convert audiences into allies\. To be effective, frames must resonate with audience mem\- bers’ existing ideas or interests; otherwise, they will fall flat and can even backfire\.1

To illustrate this, compare how two reformers—one successful, one not—framed the child labour problem at key coalition\-building moments\. When Charles Dupin, a French legislator, argued before the Cham\- ber of Peers that child labour rendered “the country weak in military powers, and poor in all the occupa\- tions of peace,”2 he was cleverly framing the issue as vital to France’s economic and national security interests\. He went on to argue that working children were likely to grow up to be criminals and deviants who would destabilize the social order\. Such frames appealed directly to the concerns of political elites and helped Dupin build a solid coalition around his proposed child labour bill\.

In contrast, when Édouard Ducpétiaux, a Belgian public administrator, framed child labour as a grave violation of children’s rights, his argument was soon used against him by chambers of commerce that were institutionally empowered to weigh in on eco\- nomic legislation—and whose support Ducpétiaux needed to move forward\. The notion that children had rights that sometimes trumped those of fathers had not yet been established by law or custom, so the employers accused Ducpétiaux of trying to upend the sacred privileges of the *pater familias *in a misguided pursuit of “foreign” policy goals\. Missteps such as these contributed to Ducpétiaux’s failure as a child labour reformer and, by extension, to Belgium’s ina\- bility to enact child labour regulation until much later in the 19th century\.

Problem solving

The second way successful reformers distinguished themselves was through their willingness to try cre\- ative, and at times risky, problem\-solving strategies\. When political opponents repeatedly impeded their

reform ambitions, they reacted by subverting nor\- mal policymaking channels in unconventional ways\. For example, when Theodor Lohmann, a Prussian commerce ministry official, found his quest for a Re\- ich\-wide system of factory inspection thwarted at every turn by his formidable boss, Otto von Bismarck, he refused to give up\. Instead, he went behind the chancellor’s back, penning anonymous op\-ed arti\- cles to drum up support, enlisting friends to lobby their political contacts and, most decisively, secretly sharing his own factory inspection bill with leaders of Germany’s second most powerful political party\. By forging an unauthorized and highly risky alliance with the legislative branch, Lohmann was eventually able to harness the Reichstag’s power and circumvent Bis\- marck’s executive authority\. Without Lohmann’s bold interventions, Germany would not have been able to mandate factory inspections across the empire, at least not until after the end of Bismarck’s reign\.

\*	\*	\*

Research on agency and policy change often high\- lights policy or institutional entrepreneurs and stresses that these actors are first and foremost coa\- lition\-builders\.3 My analysis builds on this literature by specifying various micro\-level relational strategies through which reformers forge alliances and over\- come institutional barriers\. In doing so, it lends pre\- cision to the general claim that their agency matters\. It shows, furthermore, that 19th century labour pro\- tections were not simply the outcome of dedicated reformers’ compassion or morality\. Rather, protec\- tions were enacted when reformers persuaded law\- makers that working children posed hidden threats, or harboured latent resources, that were relevant to the interests of elites and the state\. At a time when labour’s political power has eroded and policy pro\- gress still requires substantial buy\-in from political elites, these insights remain relevant for social wel\- fare reformers today\.

##### The “rational” agent and rational choice theory

An agent \(someone who acts\) makes a rational choice when acting to do as well as she believes she can to achieve her preferences\.1 There are three independ\- ent ingredients in rational choice: stable preferenc\- es, rational information processing and beliefs, and maximization\.2 What someone desires \(preferences\) is autonomous and does not change\. It is what moves people to pursue their individual self\-interest, their own wellbeing \(their utility\)\. They form their be\- lief based on information collected to help the agent make a specific decision\. For instance, if someone prefers not to get wet after leaving the house, how does she choose whether to grab an umbrella? Ra\- tional choice assumes that she makes the decision based on the combination of the preference \(to not get wet\) and the belief about whether it is going to rain—for instance, by looking out the window or con\- sulting weather forecasts, depending on how impor\- tant it is for her to not get wet\.3

This concept of agent is very general and is widely used to describe and explain human behaviour with economic models,4 framing rational choice as max\- imizing individual welfare \(typically represented by a utility function that translates consumption choic\- es into welfare\)\.5 Preferences are thus represented by a utility function that each person seeks to maxi\- mize\. Powerful extensions account for more general contexts\. When two or more agents are in a situation where their choices depend on what others do, they need to form rational expectations \(that is, assume that everyone else behaves according to rational choice\) about what the others will do\. This type of interdependent decisionmaking is studied in game

theory, which can be applied to many economic, polit\- ical and social settings\. More relevant for this Report, where there is uncertainty—that is, where different outcomes are possible, each with a different level of utility associated with it—the model is reframed as expected utility theory\. The utility \(which represents the agent’s preferences\) associated with each possible outcome is weighed by its probability of occurring and averaged out in the form of expected utility, which then represents what the agent seeks to maximize\.

Under well\-specified conditions \(for instance, everyone has access to the same information\), eco\- nomic agents make choices for what to consume and produce, exchanging what they are endowed with in markets, leading to an economic equilibrium that is reached after all the agents make their best possible choice in fulfilling their individual motivations\.6 The economic equilibrium is such that no agents can im\- prove their utility without harming someone else’s

—designated as Pareto optimality\. These results are often the justification for many policies and insti\- tutions\. Their scope is justified as correcting viola\- tions of the conditions under which this equilibrium emerges \(that is, correcting market failures, ranging from externalities, when choices have side effects that are not included in the moment of choice, to sit\- uations in which some agents have more information than others\)\. Policies and institutions often focus on structuring incentives— changing prices through taxes, for instance, to bring the actual conditions under which people make choices closer to the speci\- fied conditions under which the model yields the de\- sired Pareto optimum equilibrium\.

__NOTES __

1. The description of rational choice in this spotlight draws heavily from Elster \(2021b\)\. A more extensive treatment is presented in Elster \(2015\)\.
2. A canonical statement comes from Becker \(1976, p\. 143\): “all human be\- haviour can be viewed as involving participants who maximize their utility, form a stable set of preferences and accumulate an optimal amount of information and other inputs in a variety of markets\.”
3. The example also comes from Elster \(2021b\)\.
4. Much of the inspiration for the discussion in this spotlight comes from Hoff and Stiglitz \(2016\)\.
5. A set of axioms that are behaviourally plausible and impose a logical struc\- ture to the acts of choice that are allowed to take place is also included \(for example, if someone prefers apples to oranges and oranges to pears, she also has to prefer apples to pears\)\. For a formal treatment, includ\- ing some of the extensions discussed in this paragraph, see Mas\-Colell, Whinston and Green \(1995\)\. Key axioms are meant to ensure behaviour

where there is consistency of choice, but Sen \(1993\) argued that seem\- ingly inconsistent behaviours do not imply lack of rationality, since they may reflect the consistent use of decision strategies based on rules\. Sen \(2002\) argued that there is no way to establish internal consistency of choice without referring to something external to the act of choice \(such as values or norms\)\. Arkes, Gigerenzer and Hertwig \(2016\) argue that coherence in choice cannot be a universal benchmark of rationality\.

1. The model formalizes Adam Smith’s intuition that the pursuit of self\-interest in the context of potentially mutually beneficial economic exchange would make everyone better off, without the need for moral commitments to do\- ing something good or under the direction of a supra\-individual authority\. It is ironic that Adam Smith is remembered primarily for this insight, when much of his work was to explore the importance of different motivations for human behaviour, including the role of moral commitments or social expectations about what is acceptable behaviour\. These observations draw from Sen \(2009b\)\.

##### How can societies make progress in uncertain times? A question taking on new forms, calling for new analytical tools

__Diane Coyle, __*Cambridge University\.*

In unsettled times the perpetual question of how human societies can progress takes on new forms\. This Report diagnoses the multiple sources of inse\- curity and distress affecting so many people around the world at present and in doing so explores some possible actions policymakers might take\. Even set\- ting aside immediate pressures such as conflict\-relat\- ed food shortages and price increases, two long\-term challenges face all of us\. One is dealing with the con\- sequences of climate change\. The other is responding to the structural economic and social changes being brought about by disruptive digital technologies\. A long time in the making, both need action now, or they will increase inequalities and insecurities be\- yond the intolerable levels they have already reached\. Tackling these challenges will require new ana\- lytical tools\. This is because the phenomena of en\- vironmental damage on the one hand and digital transformation on the other do not conform to the as\- sumptions underlying much conventional economic analysis and policy recommendations\. Both areas are rife with what economists refer to as externalities or spillovers, whereby decisions have byproducts in the form of substantial consequences for others as well as the decisionmaker\. Examples are businesses that emit pollutants or carbon dioxide, causing environ\- mental and societal damage they do not have to pay for, or in the digital domain the provision of personal data that reveal information about other individuals

— or conversely that enable platforms to provide a better service to all their users\. Environmental exter\- nalities are usually negative, as natural resources are so often unpriced\. Digital externalities can be either negative or positive\.

In textbook economics the rule of thumb is that market prices capture the relevant information for the best use and allocation of resources; but it is also textbook economics that this presumption does not hold when there are pervasive externalities\. On the

contrary such situations of market failure pose col\- lective action problems\. Individual incentives lead to worse outcomes than are possible if there is coordina\- tion, led by either governments and public bodies or community\-organized institutions, as in the inspiring work of Elinor Ostrom\.

Yet although this is well known, standard econom\- ic policy tools continue to assume a simpler world where it can be reasonably believed that individual business or personal decisions generally lead to good economic outcomes, while individual market failures can be tackled one by one with specific solutions\. This default way of thinking about economic policy, deep\- ly embedded in the education and traditions of pol\- icymakers for decades, needs to change\. The world has changed beyond recognition from those mental models of individual choice\.

To give one example, digital business models using data and algorithms to deliver services are becom\- ing increasingly widespread in many countries\. They hold great promise for individual consumers—for example, enhancing access to low\-cost financial ser\- vices or providing access to markets for small and medium enterprises\. But they need an appropriate policy framework to govern their use of data and en\- sure markets remain open for new entrants\.

Data are a key resource in the digital economy, but data’s features are not like a standard economic good\. Data are “nonrival” in that they can be used by many people simultaneously and are not depleted, and data can cause harm \(a negative externality\) by uninten\- tionally revealing too much information about people at the expense of their privacy and offer benefits \(pos\- itive externalities\) when different pieces of data are joined to provide useful information\. Businesses that acquire a lot of data about users can also turn those data into a barrier to entry to limit their competition, as they are in a much better position to both improve service and earn revenues\.

Since 2019 the debate about competition policy has increasingly recognized the challenge posed by the dominance of a few companies in digital markets, which are sometimes described as “winner takes all” or “superstar” markets\. However, progress in chang\- ing policies to tackle market dominance has been slow, even in the United Kingdom and the United States, where the academic and policy debate started a few years ago\. The everyday, practical policy tools for analysis and remedies do not yet exist\.

What is more, debates about appropriate govern\- ance policies for data more generally are in their early stages\. Should data be “owned” as if a piece of property when the information that data provide is al\- ways relational or contextual? If so, given that using data creates so much value, who should be assigned property rights: the collector or the original subject or source? If not, what framework of access rights and responsibilities would generate value for society? How should data users be required to take account of data bias due to the inequality of society—and indeed of people who have no data “voice,” whose activities and needs are not measured?

Another example of an area with many open ques\- tions, due to the absence so far of an appropriate benchmark policy framework, is biodiversity policies\. Partha Dasgupta’s 2020 landmark review of the eco\- nomics of biodiversity for Her Majesty’s Treasury in

the United Kingdom synthesized the relevant theo\- retical framework, but again the spadework needs to be done to turn conceptual insights into practical interventions\. How can early warning of irreversible tipping points in ecosystems be recognized? What is the appropriate geographic scope for measuring and acting on biodiversity loss? How does it integrate with agricultural productivity or affect human health? In both arenas, environmental and digital, there has been considerable excellent academic research at the frontier of knowledge\. But to turn this into action\- able insights, the default presumption needs to be that this is a world of tipping points, multiple possible outcomes depending on current choices, external\- ities and collective action problems\. The economic analysis needs to be integrated with scientific or tech\- nical knowledge to deliver practical policy tools\. Dif\- ferent datasets are required, going beyond standard

economic metrics and dashboards\.

There are active debates among researchers and policymakers alike about these kinds of challenges and much recent progress—such as the development of statistical standards for measuring natural capital and ecosystem services\. But shaping an appropriate mindset for this uncertain, unstable and intercon\- nected world remains a challenge\.

##### Norms and cooperation in a multipolar world: Beyond economics

__Kaushik Basu, __*Cornell University*

As the world battles multiple onslaughts—from the fracturing of society, caused by the shifting rules of economic and social interaction, in turn caused by the rapid advance in digital technology, to the rise in climate\-related disasters, the Covid\-19 pandem\- ic that waxes and wanes but refuses to go, and to the war in Ukraine—it is time to rethink not just our pol\- icies but also the foundations of the social sciences\. Since much of today’s policy challenge relates to eco\- nomics, economists have written extensively on these themes, much of it captured in this Report\. There is, however, a growing contribution from neighbouring disciplines—philosophy, politics and sociology—that provide insights for economists and urge them to question some of the assumptions hidden deep in the woodwork of their own discipline\. It is important to realize that the world that we analyse is partly a con\- struction of our discipline\.1 As we try to understand society, which is on the one hand steadily globalizing and on the other becoming politically polarized with rising conflict across and within nations, it is critical to trespass boundaries and draw on these alternate disciplinary paradigms\.

Since the Age of Enlightenment, and even before that, philosophers have been aware of the need for society to nurture cooperation\. Some of this hap\- pens naturally from the nudges of the invisible hand, but we also need agreements and conventions that coordinate the behaviours of individuals\. Such agreements seem like an impossible task for our vast, multipolar world\. Hope lies in the fact that we now have a better understanding of how coopera\- tion happens and why it often breaks down\. This is because of one instrument that the Enlightenment philosophers did not have but their progenies do, to wit, game theory\. As a result, there has been a spate of recent writing that formalizes ideas from the 17th and 18th centuries and helps us think of new ways to manage society, avert conflict and foster development\.2

This new literature is helping us grapple with real\- world problems, from conflict and social inequality to the role of political leaders\. We understand these bet\- ter than ever before\. How do leaders acquire power? Why do they have such influence over individuals, at times hurting the very people who follow them? Sur\- prisingly, much of the leader’s ability to stir action among people arises from nothing but the beliefs of ordinary individuals\. The statements and orders of the leader create focal points\. You believe that, given a leader’s order or suggestion of order, others will follow it, and that in turn makes it in your inter\- est to follow it as well\. When such a confluence of be\- liefs occurs, a speech or even an utterance by a leader can unleash torrents of behaviour among individu\- als, propped up by nothing more than beliefs of what other individuals will do\.

This kind of analysis can be brought to bear on practical matters, such as the responsibility people bear towards their community3 and a leader’s respon\- sibility for the behaviour of his or her followers\. The convention is to hold a leader responsible for certain group behaviour if it can be shown that unleashing such behaviour was the leader’s intention\. Follow\- ing the above analysis, it can be argued that a lead\- er should also be held responsible for unwarranted group behaviour if the leader could reasonably be shown to have been aware that his or her speech or behaviour would result in the group behaviour, even if that was not the leader’s intention\.4 This altered view can have large implications for how we interpret the law, regulate and punish\.

Because of the large influence of economists, much of the formal analysis remains confined to individually rational behaviour\. We try to explain all forms of coop\- eration by reference to self\-interest\. This often leads to exciting mathematical models, but one consequence of this obsession is we forget that universal self\-in\- terested behaviour is one of those assumptions in the woodwork, which we take for granted but is not true\.

Virtually all human beings carry some form of moral compasses in their heads\. They desist from numerous behaviours not out of self\-interest but be\- cause their ethics, often deontological principles, do not permit them\. I believe we do not pick other peo\- ple’s pockets not because, after doing a cost\-benefit analysis, we conclude that the cost of picking pockets outweighs the benefit, but because this is an inbuilt moral code in us\.

This, in turn, raises questions about the very mean\- ing of cooperation\. Was the cooperation of Adam Smith the same as that of philosophers and scholars of politics?5 Basing our evaluation on a wider disci\- plinary foundation also raises vital questions about value, worth and equality\. We can stigmatize individ\- uals, banish individuals to the margins and exacer\- bate inequities in a variety of ways\.6 These inequities can give rise to fractures and polarizations that have little to do with economic inequality\.

Because these are subjects on the fringes of the social sciences, we know little about the connection between the nature of norms and moral codes we adhere to and the level of our economic growth and

wellbeing\. There is need for more research on this\. It is arguable that to sustain economic development, we need concurrent moral progress\. Michele Moody\-Ad\- ams argues that what is moral “progress” can be contested, but we can nevertheless take a stance on it, and she expressed optimism that moral progress can be advanced\.7 Allen Buchanan and Russell Pow\- ell take the agenda forward, showing that this can be carried over to codes of inclusivity, which are critical\- ly important in today’s polarized world\.8

As we understand these motivations that go be\- yond individual rationality, we can try to cultivate moral instincts that lead to greater harmony and co\- operation in society\. The crux of the challenge is to think of codes of behaviour that individuals as well as collectivities such as nations adhere to\. The aim is to have agreements, such as minimal constitutions, that are scientifically constructed\. This will not rule out conflict since the roots of some conflicts go beyond self\-interest\.9 Nevertheless, by nurturing certain codes of behaviour, which are often innately in us an\- yway, we can hope to stimulate empathy and further the collective good for the world\.

##### Cognitive uncertainty

__Benjamin Enke, __*Harvard University*

Many of the most important challenges facing human\- kind require tradeoffs involving uncertainty and time\. For instance, climate change mitigation measures are risky in the sense that we do not know precisely how well they will work\. Moreover, climate action in\- volves intertemporal tradeoffs because it delivers ben\- efits primarily in the future but accrues costs today\. In contexts like these, adequate decisionmaking by policymakers and individuals requires sophisticated reasoning about risk and time\. Yet, a key insight from recent research in behavioural economics is that many economically relevant decisions that involve risk or intertemporal tradeoffs are cognitively very difficult\. Consider the following two illustrative examples:

- 
	- Suppose you are offered an investment that pays

$1,000 with a probability of 35 percent and nothing with a probability of 65 percent\. How much would you be willing to pay for such an asset? Maybe

$220? Are you sure? How about $185? Or $342?

- 
	- Now suppose you actually won $1,000 and your banker offers you a safe annual interest rate of 4 percent\. How much of your new wealth would you like to save at this interest rate rather than spend this year? $600? Are you sure? Not $775 or $452?

surveys document that when people are cognitive\- ly uncertain, they anchor on a so\-called cognitive default decision\.2 A cognitive default decision is the naïve decision people would make in the absence of any deliberation: what they would do if they did not really think about it\. In contexts with which people have experience, this could be a decision they pre\- viously made\. In contexts with which people do not have experience, the cognitive default is often to pick something intermediate or a compromise\. Regard\- less of what the decision is, much evidence shows that when people are cognitively uncertain, they an\- chor on, or regress to, a cognitive default\.3 As a result, people’s decisions are often poorly calibrated to the prevailing set of circumstances, in particular under new environmental conditions\.

The following sections explore these abstract ideas in more concrete contexts, by studying how people think about probabilities \(uncertainty\) and intertem\- poral tradeoffs and then by discussing more spec\- ulatively how cognitive uncertainty and cognitive default decisions may matter for understanding and addressing current societal challenges\.

These examples illustrate a principle that is very gen\-		

eral: in a large range of decisions, people exhibit cogni\- tive uncertainty, meaning that they do not know which decision is actually best for them, given their prefer\- ences\. Cognitive uncertainty refers to a purely internal

—cognitive—form of uncertainty, rather than objective uncertainty about the physical world\. Cognitive un\- certainty is the result of people’s imperfect ability to determine the optimal course of action in complex sit\- uations\. The empirical reality that people often exhibit cognitive uncertainty contrasts with the approach tra\- ditionally taken by behavioural economists, which is to assume that people may make mistakes but are not aware of their own cognitive imperfections\.1

Why is cognitive uncertainty important? A main reason is that a growing number of experiments and

Decisionmaking under uncertainty

Almost all economically relevant decisions involve some risk\. As a result, much research in economics and psychology studies how people learn from in\- formation, how they make predictions about future events \(such as the probability that they will lose their job\) and how they choose among different invest\- ment strategies \(such as whether and how to invest in the stock market\)\. All these domains require people to process probabilities\. Yet, substantial research has documented that people have a pronounced tendency to make decisions that look as if they implicitly treat all probabilities to some degree alike, which produces a compression\-to\-the\-centre effect \(figure S3\.6\.1\)\.4

The left panel of figure S3\.6\.1 shows the canonical probability weighting function that depicts how peo\- ple typically weight probabilities when they choose among different monetary gambles\. For example, people overweight a 5 percent chance of winning

$100 but underweight a 95 percent chance of win\- ning that amount\. Thus, in essence, people treat both high and low probabilities as more intermediate than they really are\. This is a regularity that economists have devoted much attention to, as it helps explain phenomena such as casino gambling, the overpricing of positively skewed financial assets, the equity pre\- mium and why people prefer insurance policies with low deductibles\.5

The middle panel illustrates a common way in which people’s inferences from new information tend to be systematically wrong\. When people receive in\- formation suggesting that a specified event is objec\- tively very unlikely to occur, they often overestimate such small probabilities\. On the other hand, when people receive information suggesting that an event is very likely to occur, they underestimate such high probabilities, which again leads to a compression ef\- fect towards the centre\.

Finally, the right panel shows a typical pattern re\- garding people’s expectations of how much the stock market will go up, as a function of objective probabil\- ities\. Again, people’s probability estimates are typi\- cally heavily compressed towards the centre, which means that people are overly optimistic as far as very unlikely scenarios are unconcerned but overly pessi\- mistic when it comes to very likely scenarios\.

The similarity of compression effects in these three probability domains is striking\. Yet, until recently, economists and psychologists often viewed them as separate phenomena, rather than as being driven by a common cognitive mechanism\.6

One way of jointly accounting for these patterns across different domains is the simple insight that people find it cognitively difficult to think about prob\- abilities and, therefore, anchor on an intermediate cognitive default decision\.7 The main idea is that people mentally start out from an intermediate de\- cision, something that is far from the extremes and feels moderate\. Upon deliberation, they then insuffi\- ciently adjust in the direction of the rational decision \(the decision that would be expected under a stand\- ard rational choice model\)\. Crucially, the idea is that

the magnitude of the adjustment towards the ration\- al decision decreases in cognitive uncertainty\. Thus, people who are extremely cognitively uncertain will decide based purely on the cognitive default deci\- sion, while people who do not exhibit any cognitive uncertainty will make a rational decision\. According to this hypothesis, cognitively uncertain decisions are more compressed towards the centre\.

Testing of this hypothesis through a series of ex\- periments and surveys that measured people’s cog\- nitive uncertainty revealed that in all three decision

decisions\. Likewise, cognitively uncertain people underestimate the probability of likely events and underweight low probabilities when they translate them into risky decisions\. However, these patterns do not arise because people have acquired do\- main\-specific errors or even preferences—instead, they reflect a general heuristic according to which people find it difficult to think about probabilities and, therefore, treat different probabilities to some degree alike\.

domains in figure S3\.6\.1, the gist of the results was		

the same: higher cognitive uncertainty is strongly associated with greater compression of decisions towards the centre \(figure S3\.6\.2\)\.8 Intuitively, this makes sense: when people do not know how to value a risky asset, or if they do not know how to form probabilistic estimates about variables such as stock market returns, they anchor on an intermediate de\- cision and then only partially adjust away from it\. As a result, cognitively uncertain people overestimate the probability of unlikely events and overweight low probabilities when they translate them into risky

Intertemporal decisions

Consider now an entirely different set of decisions, in which people trade off money \(or other goods\) at different points in time\. For example, an experiment participant may be asked whether she would prefer to receive $90 today or $100 in a year from now\. A large body of empirical work has documented that people’s intertemporal decisions are often characterized by a type of compression effect that is very similar to the one seen in the case of probabilities\.9

S3\.6\.3 illustrates this by showing how much peo\- ple typically value a payment of $100 to be received at different points in time\. For example, the left panel shows that, on average, people value $100 in nine months roughly as much as $60 today and that they value $100 in four years as much as $40 today\. The main takeaway is that people’s decisions seem to treat different time delays to some degree alike\. For example, people seem to behave as if it makes almost no difference to them whether they receive $100 in two years or in three\. Overall, this leads to a compres\- sion effect, according to which people’s valuation of a delayed payment of $100 is again compressed to\- wards an intermediate value of roughly $50\.

Popular models such as the standard discounted expected utility model, or models of present bias,10 cannot explain these puzzling patterns\. For example, the extreme compression effect towards the centre also occurs when people make decisions that involve tradeoffs between two future dates \(right panel of fig\- ure S3\.6\.3\), such that present bias cannot play a role\.

One hypothesis is that these patterns do not \(only\) reflect present bias or other nonstandard preferences

but that they are again driven by complexity and re\- sulting cognitive uncertainty\.11 The intuition is that when people are cognitively uncertain about exactly how much a payment of $100 in three years is worth to them today, they again anchor on an intermediate cognitive default decision and then adjust from there

—but insufficiently so\. According to this hypothesis, relative to the benchmark of a rational decisionmak\- er, people with cognitive uncertainty will look less pa\- tient over short horizons \(because the intermediate cognitive default “drags down” their patience\), yet they will appear more patient over long horizons\.

Experiments measuring people’s cognitive un\- certainty when making these types of intertemporal decisions show that cognitive uncertainty is strongly predictive of the degree to which people’s intertem\- poral decisions seem to treat all time delays alike \(figure S3\.6\.4\)\.12 As a result, cognitively uncertain people exhibit excessively high impatience over short horizons, such as in tradeoffs between today and in three months\. However, in contrast to conventional preferences\-based accounts of intertemporal choice, such impatience does not largely reflect genuinely

low patience but instead people’s inability to think through the decision problem\.

Recap: Commonalities across decision domains

The common theme that emerges from the preced\- ing discussion is that people’s inability to think through tricky decision problems is a unifying el\- ement that ties together various behaviours\. How people update their beliefs in light of new informa\- tion, how they choose between different risky assets and how they trade off different time\-dated rewards are, in principle, three different domains of econom\- ic decisionmaking\. Indeed, economists have devised sophisticated models for each of these domains\. Yet, while there is much benefit in focusing on each deci\- sion domain in isolation, doing so also sometimes ob\- scures important commonalities across domains\. In particular, we have seen that people are often unsure what the best decision is, that cognitive uncertainty is strongly linked to taking “intermediate” decisions

that make it seem as if people treat different proba\- bilities and time delays alike and that this mechanism generates many of the famous empirical regularities that behavioural economists and psychologists have accumulated over the years\. According to the logic of cognitive uncertainty, these regularities are all inti\- mately linked\.

Potential implications for societal challenges

The main takeaway from the studies summarized above is that when people are cognitively uncertain

—that is, when they find a decision problem difficult to think through—they anchor on a cognitive default and then insufficiently adjust in the direction of the rational decision\. As a result, decisions look as if peo\- ple underreact to changes in the prevailing circum\- stances such as the probabilities of different events\.

In experiments the default decision is consistently intermediate in nature, which could reflect a naïve di\- versification or compromise logic\. Yet, these choice experiments all involve contexts with which most people have limited or no experience\. This raises the question what constitutes people’s cognitive default decision in situations with which they do have expe\- rience, as is usually the case in reality\.

A plausible conjecture is that when people are cog\- nitively uncertain “in the wild,” they intuitively an\- chor on their typical past decision and then adjust from there\. For instance, people who always save

$100 of their salary might continue to do so even when the interest rate suddenly changes—purely be\- cause they find the decision very difficult to think through and they therefore anchor on their past deci\- sion\.13 Again, such a pattern of behaviour would pro\- duce an underreaction to changes in environmental conditions\.

This perspective offers a new lens through which behaviour in the general public regarding societal challenges can be understood\. For example, thinking through the consequences of climate change for one’s own life is cognitively extremely challenging\. Even if we knew for certain that temperatures will rise by 3°C over the next 30 years, it is very hard \(even for experts\) to think through how this would affect the structure of our economies and lifestyles\. In other words it is most likely true that people exhibit very

high cognitive uncertainty when thinking through which personal decisions they should take in light of climate change\. Which skills will be valued 30 years from now? How should I optimally behave in light of these changes? How and where should I optimally choose to live given these developments?

Even in the absence of any objective uncertainty about the physical word, these questions are cogni\- tively extremely difficult to think through\. This cog\- nitive difficulty may induce people to anchor on the cognitive default of making the same decisions as in the past, which then mechanically produces an un\- derreaction to changes in economic and climatic con\- ditions\. For example, the relatively low investment into climate change adaptation in the past may serve as a cognitive anchor for determining today’s invest\- ments\. If true, this would suggest that the apparent underreaction in the population to new economic or

climatic conditions partly reflects the cognitive dif\- ficulty of thinking through complex topics, rather than necessarily selfish or short\-sighted preferences\. This account is potentially valuable because it adds a new perspective and policy prescription\. Rather than lament about people’s preferences or even try to change them, policymakers may be more successful at inducing people to adjust their behaviours by helping them imagine and think through a future with climate change: what people’s lives will look like, which types of jobs they will be competing for, how they will com\- mute to work and what their children will learn\. Only when people understand the implications of abstract policy discussions for which decisions they need to make to prepare themselves for the future—once peo\- ple have reduced their cognitive uncertainty—may they be able to make the decisions that policymakers and international organizations are hoping for\.

##### Human agency can help restore biodiversity: The case of forest transitions

__Erle C\. Ellis, __*University of Maryland, Baltimore County*

Biodiversity losses are increasingly recognized as a global crisis demanding transformative changes in human societies to halt further losses and to better conserve and restore biodiversity\.1 Forest habitats generally sustain more species than other terrestrial biomes, and moist tropical forests are among the most biodiverse ecosystems on Earth\.2 As a result, the con\- version, degradation and fragmentation of forests and other biodiverse wild habitats by agriculture and other intensive land uses are currently the leading cause of biodiversity losses across the terrestrial biosphere\.3

For more than a century, human demands for food, fibre and other land use products have soared to sus\- tain the growth of increasingly well\-off populations and their choice of richer diets, including animal products and other land\-demanding commodities\.4 To meet these demands, land use for crops and pas\- tures have replaced forests and other habitats across more than 35 percent of Earth’s ice\-free land area\.5 Yet despite this alarming long\-term trend, the glob\- al area of agricultural land has not increased signif\- icantly since the 1990s, even while the amount of food produced per capita has risen faster than popu\- lation for more than half a century\.6

Biodiversity losses remain a serious concern as the global area used for intensive crops continues to grow, both within existing agricultural areas and through deforestation, especially in less developed tropical regions, where biodiversity losses from land conver\- sion are greatest\.7 Nevertheless, tropical deforesta\- tion appears to be slowing, and forests and other wild habitats are regenerating in the more developed tem\- perate regions of the world where less suitable agri\- cultural land is being abandoned\.8 Though it remains unlikely that global forest area in 2030 could increase by 3 percent relative to 2015 to meet target 1\.1 of the United Nations Strategic Plan for Forests, annual net loss of forests has been nearly halved since the 1990s, to about 0\.1 percent a year, as a result of declining de\- forestation rates and increasing forest regeneration

rates\.9 Clearly, some forest trends are going in the right direction, especially in the more developed re\- gions of the world\.

The large\-scale regeneration of forests following the abandonment of agricultural land was first identified as a general pattern of forest recovery in developed re\- gions of Europe starting in the late 1800s\.10 In recent decades these so\-called forest transitions, defined as sustained regional shifts from net deforestation to net reforestation, are increasingly being observed in contemporary temperate and tropical regions around the world\.11 The early forest transitions of Europe, the United States and elsewhere were first explained by an economic development pathway in which urban\- ization and industrialization drove labour scarcity in agriculture, leading to agricultural intensification to in\- crease total production using the most suitable lands, enabling profits to be maximized and leading to the abandonment of less productive agricultural lands, where forests then regenerated spontaneously\.12

More recently, “economic” forest transitions have also been explained, to some degree, through “land use displacement pathways,” in which forests recover in one region while potentially being lost in another, when agricultural demands are outsourced through globalized supply chains, often to developing regions of the tropics\.13 In land use displacement pathways the biodiversity benefits of forest regeneration may be reversed many times over, unless the receiving ag\- ricultural region has very high yields \(and therefore lower net land area requirements\), owing to the high\- er biodiversity of most tropical regions and the poten\- tial for land use conversions through deforestation\.14 Additional pathways towards forest transitions have emerged in recent decades, including state and non\- governmental organization–supported tree planting programmes and through land use policies and reg\- ulatory pathways supporting forest conservation and restoration to meet international targets for carbon and biodiversity\.15

Global supply chain transparency initiatives and voluntary certification of sustainable production are helping reduce losses of tropical forests produced through land use displacement\.16 But there is still a long way to go\.17 Even though forest transitions are increasingly evident around the world, including in many developing tropical regions,18 at the global scale, biodiversity losses remain inevitable whenever land use is simply exported to other regions,19 unless their productivity is substantially higher or their bio\- diversity is substantially lower\.

The ultimate prospects for a global forest transi\- tion to halt losses of biodiversity will depend on the

degree to which commodity demands can be met by increasingly intensive land use practices that shrink land demand overall—the classic “economic” path\- way of urban and industrial development—combined with efforts to prioritize the conservation and resto\- ration of the most biodiverse regions on Earth\.20 The pace of this development, including urbanization and agricultural intensification, and the governance of global commodity supply chains21 will ultimately determine not only the fate of Earth’s remaining bio\- diversity but also the future of human opportunities with respect to food, housing, employment, recrea\- tion and other essential conditions\.

13 4	HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2021/2022 

Beyond causing frustration and unsettling minds \(chapter 2\), the uncertainties described in chapter 1 can also undermine the ability to act collectively\. Uncertainty has different manifestations\. At the in\- dividual level it can be seen in the form of human insecurity\. This chapter shows that perceptions of in\- security are associated with mistrust and with politi\- cal polarization—people who feel insecure trust others less and are more prone to politically extreme posi\- tions\. Meanwhile, changes to our information systems

are reshaping how people form beliefs and how they interact with one another\. The social changes brought on by rapidly evolving digital communications tech\- nology place additional pressures on human interac\- tion\. Together, these two shifts are jeopardizing public deliberation and social choice \(chapter 4\)\. But uncer\- tainty can also open new possibilities for action, since it can reframe what is perceived as possible and need\- ed: this is explored in chapter 5, on the way to chapter 6, which provides suggestions on the way forward\.

What’s standing in the way of our acting together?

The paradox of our time is paralysis: we know what the problems are, we have more tools than ever to address them, but we are failing to act\.

Why? What is getting in the way?

This chapter points to polarization and how

uncertainty and insecurity can exacerbate it\. Trust is down; political extremism is up\. Hyperinformation is sowing division\. Spaces for public deliberation are shrinking right when they are needed most\.

13 8	HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2021/2022 

<a id="_bookmark77"></a>The  unprecedented  multilayered  uncertainties

— coming from the Anthropocene context, social and technological transformations and political polarization—test our social, economic and political institutions, as well as the patterns of behaviour that shape and are shaped by those institutions\. The link between the two, as chapter 3 discusses, is the result of procedures of social choice, reflected in how socie\- ties craft collective responses\.

Why has it proven so difficult to craft these collec\- tive responses, which demand changes in both behav\- iour and institutions, despite clear evidence of harm to come for people, societies and the planet? Chapter 3 argues that current configurations of behaviour and institutions are not responding effectively to a novel context of uncertainty\. This mismatch increases the importance of processes of public deliberation and social choice in shaping the behavioural and insti\- tutional changes needed in an uncertain world\. Pro\- cesses of social choice that harness people’s diverse goals, motivations, beliefs and emotions can be a powerful driver of social change\.

However, in many countries today, processes of public deliberation and social choice are coming

uncertainty on collective responses, taking us from a confused reacting mode to a purposeful harnessing of uncertainty towards a hopeful future\.

Uncertain times, divided societies

The layers of uncertainty discussed in chapter 1 are interacting to produce new shocks and dislocations\. But uncertainty is not only about shocks and disloca\- tions; it is also about growing gaps in our collective ability to “make sense” of the world when deciding our actions\. Progress in recent decades has been re\- markable in many aspects of human development, particularly in wellbeing achievements, despite marked \(and in some cases increasing\) inequalities \(see chapter 1\)\.6 But despite widespread progress in wellbeing achievements, around half the population does not see progress in their living standards relative to those of their parents\. About 40 percent of those who have more education than their parents do not perceive intergenerational progress, vividly showing how expectations of higher future living standards are being dashed\.7

under strain amid intensifying political polarization		

and divisiveness\.1 Political polarization can be under\- stood as “the extent to which citizens become ideo\- logically entrenched in their own values and political beliefs, thereby increasing the divide with citizens who hold different values and political beliefs\.”2 Po\- larization tends to make people close in on their in\- groups and be reluctant to interact, exchange and communicate with out\-groups\. Affective polarization

—the tendency to view out\-group members negative\- ly and in\-group members positively3—antagonizes people across partisan lines\.4 This animosity is added to the other forms of issue\-based and ideological po\- larization between groups that have long been stud\- ied in sociology and political science\.5

This chapter explores how polarization can inten\- sify because of two intertwined developments\. First, the unsettling of people’s lives and experiences of human insecurity\. Second, the massive economic, social and political shift driven by a rapidly chang\- ing \(digital\) information context\. It discusses how political polarization might diminish the space for imaginative, effective and just actions needed today, before suggesting how we might break the hold of

Uncertainty and human insecurity parallel increases in polarization

When uncertainty translates into unsettled lives and human insecurity, it can increase polarization, im\- pacting processes of social choice\. Building on the analysis in chapter 3, the following discussion high\- lights the importance of considering beliefs, motiva\- tions and emotions as factors accounting for why it seems hard for people to act individually and collec\- tively in the face of uncertainty\. Together, these fac\- tors shape the issues people find important, people’s attitudes and behaviours towards others, and the ac\- tions people support or undertake themselves\.8

When uncertainty translates into unsettled lives and human insecurity, it can increase polarization, impacting the processes of social choice

“

What is the connection between uncertain times and a range of beliefs that matter for public deliber\- ation? Here we use the World Values Survey, whose

<a id="_bookmark78"></a>representative sample covers around 80 percent of the global population, to check how people’s percep\- tions of insecurity appear connected with beliefs that worsen polarization\. Perceived human insecurity is a partial measure of individual uncertainty that mir\- rors how people’s fundamental freedoms \(from want, fear and indignity\) are being affected today \(box 4\.1\)\. We first show how perceived human insecurity is connected with people’s feelings of agency and con\- trol over their lives and with their trust in others\. The evidence here suggests that greater human insecuri\- ty is linked to lower individual agency and trust\. We then explore associations between perceived human insecurity and people’s political preferences, show\- ing that greater human insecurity is linked to people holding extreme political preferences\. The combina\- tion of high insecurity, lower interpersonal trust and high polarization is more prevalent in low Human Development Index \(HDI\) countries and among lower\-income people\.

__Box 4\.1 The Index of Perceived Human Insecurity__

To track human insecurity, we use the Index of Perceived Human Insecurity\. It is based on wave 6 \(2010–2014\) and wave 7 \(2015–2022\) of the World Values Survey1 and reflects mainly a pre\-Covid\-19 context\. The index is computed for 77 countries and territories, covering around 80 percent of the global population\. It combines 17 variables covering violent conflict and socioeconomic, personal and community\-level insecurity\. These insecuri\- ties reflect challenges to freedom from want, freedom from fear and freedom from indignity\.

- For insecurity from violent conflict, the index uses variables reflecting worries about a war involving the country of residence, a civil war or a terrorist attack\.
- For socioeconomic insecurity the index uses variables representing explicit worries \(losing a job, not being able to give children education\) and actual depriva\- tions in health, food and economic security\.
- For insecurity at the personal and community levels, the index uses variables of exposure to crime, change in habits because of security concerns, overall safety perception of the neighbourhood and assessment of specific risks \(including robbery, alcohol and drugs on the streets, abuse by law enforcement and racism\)\.

__*Greater human insecurity is linked with lower individual agency and trust*__

Human insecurity can directly restrict human agen\- cy\. High human insecurity reduces people’s ability to make autonomous decisions because of lack of resources, because of fear or because of social dis\- crimination\. These effects often extend to the overall perception of agency to make choices over their own lives: people with greater human insecurity tend to perceive lower agency \(figure 4\.1\)\.9

Trust in one another influences prospects for co\- operation in a group\. People tend to trust people clos\- er to them \(such as family\) more than people whom they do not know or who have a different social back\-

Inter\- personal trust \(the most general trust, in essential\- ly any human being\) has been declining over time\. Globally, fewer than 30 percent of people think that “most people can be trusted,” the lowest recorded value\. There is a close association between interper\- sonal trust and human security\.13

ground \(as with different nationalities or religions\)\.		

Lower trust in socially “distant” people influences social discrimination,10 among other socioeconomic outcomes\.11 This pattern tends to be stronger across individuals with low incomes and with greater human insecurity \(figure 4\.2\)\.12 In other words people with high incomes and high human security have greater trust in people from more socially distant groups\.

Addressing the common challenges that we con\- front today requires cooperation in contexts beyond those where intragroup cooperation tends to be high—in particular, addressing planetary challenges

__*Greater human insecurity is linked to political extremism*__

Greater human insecurity is also linked to political extremism, understood as attitudes and behaviours representing polar views or the single\-minded pursuit of one goal over others\.14 We capture the first aspect using preferences along the left\-right political spec\- trum\. People experiencing greater human insecu\- rity tend to have a stronger preference for the polar extremes of the political spectrum: the proportion of

own in\-groups and out\-groups\. Here, we consider ev\- idence on some of the factors known to contribute to polarization:

- Behavioural drivers affected by a context of un\- certainty can intensify people’s identification with their own social groups\. Adding to this is that peo\- ple in one group are also generally prone to forming incorrect beliefs about people in other groups, with implications for prospects of cooperation across groups\.
- Institutional drivers, particularly those associated with inequalities and disruptive changes in our in\- formation systems\.

of beliefs: diminished agency, lack of trust in others and more extreme political beliefs\. The next section expands this discussion to additional behavioural fac\- tors that can contribute to polarization, as well as in\- stitutional conditions that drive polarization\.

*Behavioural factors*

There is some evidence of a causal link between mul\- tiple manifestations of uncertainty and political po\- larization\.18 It comes from different disciplines, with several noting the need for humans to reduce or “re\- solve” uncertainty\.19 For instance, the “need for clo\- sure” or the “desire for a definite answer on some topic, any answer as opposed to confusion and am\- biguity…”20 appears as a key motivation for human behaviour\.

According to the significance quest theory, people need social worth and significance\.21 This need is ac\- tivated by deprivation \(rooted in failure, humiliation or rejection\) or incentivization \(the opportunity to boost one’s significance\), which are linked to mani\- festations of human insecurity and uncertainty in general\. When activated, the quest for significance enhances ideological narratives that support the values of people’s group or culture that give mean\- ing to their lives\. As a result, people can be attract\- ed to affiliating with social identities that become an “antidote” to uncertainty, social identities that are in part affirmed as being different—at the limit, completely opposite—from others, which can lead to polarization\.22

Another form of adjustment could be through group identification, as in the uncertainty identity theory: feelings of uncertainty \(particularly related to self\) motivate people to identify with, switch to or reform social groups in order to cope with those feel\- ings\.23 Self\-uncertainty strengthens group identifica\- tion, favouring groups with greater distinctiveness

and clear leadership\. Through this process self\-un\- certainty facilitates radicalization \(self\-identification with more extreme groups and well\-delimited iden\- tities\), potentially culminating in the support of more authoritarian leaders\.24 More generally, experimental analysis of brain activity through magnetic resonance imaging indicates that people with greater intoler\- ance of uncertainty are more likely to show more neural synchrony with politically like\-minded peers and less with opponents, fuelling the formation of po\- larized beliefs\.25

These mechanisms can be exploited by political entities and leaders, targeting individuals struggling with high personal uncertainty through compelling narratives that are embraced even if they include the justification of extreme behaviours, such as politi\- cal violence\.26 Attractive extreme political ideologies often connect to people’s distress, cognitive simplici\- ty \(such as a black\-and\-white perception of the social world\), overconfidence in judgment and intolerance towards alternative views because of perceived moral superiority\.27 Elites are often politically incentivized

<a id="_bookmark82"></a>to fuel polarization, with direct negative campaigns, uncivil discourse and vitriol against political oppo\- nents28 or to leverage divisions over contentious so\- cial issues, such as immigration and race in some settings\.29 Elite polarization has been found to result in greater affective polarization in the electorate— when elite positions are polarized, people express more negative sentiment towards opposing par\- ties30 and become more tolerant of undemocratic behaviour\.31

The confluence of heightened uncertainty with high inequality often seems to favour support

“

for authoritarian leaders, who are less likely to foster intragroup and intergroup cooperation

The style of leadership supported in uncertain times may also favour support for authoritarian lead\- ers\. Anthropology and social psychology have iden\- tified two routes through which leaders emerge\.32 One is by acquiring prestige, respect and admiration and being recognized as possessing superior skills, achievements or knowledge\. The other is by becom\- ing dominant, assertive, controlling, decisive and confident, often coercing or inducing fear\. In contexts of economic uncertainty dominant leaders often ap\- pear to have greater appeal than prestige leaders\.33 And higher economic inequality also attracts and often favours support for dominance\-oriented lead\- ers, with inequality also providing incentives for lead\- ers to pursue their own self\-interest over the interests of the groups they lead\.34 The confluence of height\- ened uncertainty with high inequality thus often seems to favour support for authoritarian leaders, who are less likely to foster intragroup and intergroup cooperation\.

Polarization has to do with a group forming nega\- tive beliefs about other out\-groups, and people are generally prone to forming such beliefs in an incor\- rect way\. A substantial body of evidence shows that people’s perceptions about others are generally bi\- ased\.35 People can misjudge what other individuals in society think, feel and do\.36 Not only is mispercep\- tion of others widespread, it also tends to be asym\- metric: far more people hold beliefs about others that fall on one side of the truth over the other\.37 In par\- ticular, people harbour greater misperceptions when considering those outside their own social groups

than those closer to them\. Inaccurate perceptions about out\-groups are widespread, with evidence to this effect over localized points of disagreement in 26 countries\.38

Indeed, people’s perception that others hold more extreme positions than they actually do itself contrib\- utes to polarization\. People’s perception that those from opposing parties hold extreme positions has been found to be more strongly associated with an\- imus towards out\-party members than with actual differences in policy preferences\.39 People who iden\- tify with a specific group underestimate the extent to which they agree with the views of other groups’ opponents\.40 People also tend to misperceive how others view them\. These perceptions are uniquely associated with hostility, aggression and in some set\- tings a willingness to violate democratic norms\.41

What might explain people’s tendencies to routine\- ly misperceive others? One candidate is stereotyping, where people tend to adopt overgeneralized mental models of out\-group members\. Another is motivated reasoning: people are biased towards interpreting in\- formation in ways that affirm their beliefs\. So, affec\- tive factors could be contributing to misperception \(rather than the other way around—misperceptions causing people to have negative attitudes towards others\)\.42

*Institutional factors*

The rise in polarization today comes alongside progress in other dimensions of human wellbeing

—greater economic prosperity, uptake of new tech\- nologies, and improvements in health, education and gender equality—and despite the formal strengthen\- ing of socioeconomic institutions \(box 4\.2\)\. Increas\- ing polarization amid greater progress signals that what is often called “development” may not always deliver for people as expected\.

In\-group–out\-group polarization can be framed in the context of the potential mismatch discussed in chapter 3\. A rapid transformation with new lay\- ers of uncertainty can shake norms and values that are ill matched to current realities\. This triggers ad\- vocates of new responses, risking polarization be\- tween advocates for change and those rejecting or alienated by change\.43 Intragroup cohesiveness can increase when people are confronted with threats but often at the expense of intergroup cooperation\.

<a id="_bookmark83"></a>__Box 4\.2 Progress with polarization in the global Positive Peace Index__

The Positive Peace Index measures the positive peace of 163 countries, covering 99\.6 percent of the world popula\- tion\. Positive peace is defined as the attitudes, institutions and structures that create and sustain peaceful societies\. It is based on more than 45,700 data series, indices and attitudinal survey variables in conjunction with current thinking about the drivers of violent conflict, resilience and peacefulness\. The index covers eight pillars, using three

indicators for each\. The pillars are:

- Well\-functioning government\.
- Equitable distribution of resources\.
- Free flow of information\.
- Good relations with neighbours\.
- High human capital\.
- Acceptance of the rights of others\.
- Low corruption\.
- Sound business environment\.

The 24 indicators fall into three domains:

- Attitudes, which measure social views, tensions or perceptions\.

attitudes—that is, the way individuals and groups perceive and interact within their society\.

__Source: __Pinto and others 2022\.

- Deteriorations in attitudes are changes in social perceptions and patterns of interactions among individuals and groups that lead to more social disharmony, more violence or fear thereof, deeper political instability or more disruptive economic inefficiencies\.
- Improvements in attitudes are changes in social perceptions and patterns of interaction among individuals and groups that lead to enhanced social cohesion, less violence, more political cooperation, greater institutional trans\- parency and economic efficiencies\.

Using this classification framework, the data suggest a steep divergence in development patterns over the past 10 years \(box figure 1\)\. The global average of the structures domain suggests uninterrupted progress, as gauges of ag\- gregate economic performance, scientific and technological development, and business indicators have continually improved since 2009\. By contrast, the global averages of the attitudes domain have deteriorated markedly—a proxy for polarization\. The institutions domain has also deteriorated, though modestly\.

This is the paradox of economic and business progress with increasing social polarization\. Despite improvements in aggregate economic performance, technological advancement and business opportunities, societies appear to have become less harmonious, and political preferences appear to have become more factionalized and intolerant\.

__Source: __Pinto and others 2022\.

For instance, after violent conflict, trust and cooper\- ation increase within groups but not between them\.44 War also seems to increase religiosity, another form

of affiliating with a social group based on shared be\- liefs\.45 People seek to reduce ambivalence in their per\- ception of others by creating clear “us” and “them”

<a id="_bookmark84"></a>boundaries\.46 The tightening47 of social norms and their heightened enforcement or sanctioning are also a collective response to cope with threats and uncertainty48—perhaps an evolved cultural adaption to deal collectively with uncertainty\.49 But mismatch\- es can occur when some societies overtighten norms in the face of perceived tangible threats and loosen them in the face of real threats\.50

Economic hardship and income inequality might parallel trends in polarization\.51 Beliefs and behav\- iours prioritizing in\-group affiliation can emerge as coping mechanisms in times of economic volatility and rising inequality, possibly leading to group po\- larization\.52 This acquires different manifestations in different geographic contexts, but large num\- bers of people around the world are already feeling the dislocations associated with the implications of trade, technology or both\. In nearly all high\-income and upper middle\-income countries, wage income to workers is shrinking as a share of GDP\.53 Pros\- pects will improve for some people— those with the enhanced capabilities to seize on the opportunities of the 21st century\.54 But other groups will feel less secure—those seeing their livelihoods or social status threatened\. In times of hardship or in places where dislocations cause economic hardship, polarization intensifies, and support can increase for leaders who reject pluralism, including those hostile to foreigners and migrants\.55

Inequalities, and perceptions of inequality,56 may undermine the basic promise of fundamental po\- litical equality\.57 It is argued that we are witness\- ing the secession from political life58 of those at the very top, isolated and disconnected through their privilege, and those at the very bottom, disaffect\- ed and disenfranchised in their agency and voice\. These inequalities— especially income and wealth inequality—have an impact on political engagement,59 which often translates into low political participa\- tion among the most disadvantaged\.60 Institutions have sometimes struggled to safeguard the integrity of the rituals of choice whereby societies can collec\- tively and iteratively design their fate and determine the winning and losing political positions without un\- dermining formal systems and without disagreement turning into disrespect of others and of institutions\.61 In recent decades inequalities have been accom\- panied by rising nationalism and identity\-based

politics in many countries\. There is substantial vari\- ation across countries in how class\-based inequalities interact with other social divides, leading to diverse patterns in political cleavages; how political institu\- tions manage these cleavages also influences dynam\- ics between groups \(spotlight 4\.1\)\.

Inequalities, and perceptions of inequality, may undermine the basic promise of fundamental political equality

“

Widening inequalities and worsening prospects for many workers around the world are connected to the global rise of market power of some firms: as the winner\-takes\-all structure of new technologies paired with challenged antitrust policies allows some com\- panies to thrive with high profits, while lower shares of income accrue to workers\.62 The rise in market power can lead to monopolistic competition, raising company profits while keeping worker wages low\.63 Firms that were able to innovate in new information platforms are now giants of technology\. These “su\- perstar” firms, with a high capacity to innovate and very high profits, have seen rising market power\. Their markups \(the difference between sales prices and production costs\) are high, contributing to the decline in the labour’s share of income\.64

Hyper\-information is powering social division and polarization

As chapter 3 argues, we may be confronting a mis\- match between behaviour and the institutions that exist now and those required to navigate through a new context of multilayered uncertainties\.65 In addi\- tion, the world faces another mismatch between the availability of information \(about people’s actions, interactions and perceptions, captured through mul\- tiple platforms and social media\) and our ability to effectively harness it in processes of social choice\.66 Changes to how we produce and share information are part of a broader social and cultural change\. The ubiquity of information and communications tech\- nology today signifies a substantially different world from just a few decades ago\. Technological advanc\- es are dramatically altering how people form their beliefs and values and how these are transmitted

<a id="_bookmark85"></a>through social connections and networks\. People in\- teracting with one another on digital networks are en\- gaging in new cultural practices\.67 New social groups and networks can emerge online that are widely dis\- tributed and decentralized, involving only loosely connected individuals\. As this section discusses, the social changes generated by the rapidly evolving \(dig\- ital\) information ecosystem are introducing new vul\- nerabilities to processes of public deliberation, even as they support collective action in other ways\.

__*Advances in digital technology are disrupting social networks*__

In many respects digital social media can support processes of public deliberation\. The free flow of in\- formation is fundamental to democratic process\- es\. Accurate information allows people to develop well\-informed policy preferences, hold those in power accountable and participate meaningfully in democratic debate\. Information is an important part of any strategy to address the complex challenges be\- fore us\. For instance, information about the extent and scale of climate change is important for spurring actions to minimize human\-induced pressures on the planet\. And technologies for sharing information, such as social media, play an important role in sup\- porting collective action\. Digital social media pro\- vide new ways for groups to interact, find common ground and even organize into movements\. There are several such examples of digital media supporting collective action, from protesting racial or ethnic vio\- lence to advocating for workers’ rights and the rights of gender\-diverse groups and indigenous peoples\. Communications technology promises a means for marginalized, minoritized or threatened groups to or\- ganize and effect change\.

However, recent advances in digital communi\- cations technology have also been disruptive to our social networks, more so than communications ad\- vances in the past \(box 4\.3\)\. There are at least four key changes in our social systems as a result of rapid advances in information and communications tech\- nology\.68 They have dramatically altered the stability and functionality of social networks\.

- *Changes in scale\. *Social networks have expanded massively in scale, to nearly 7\.8 billion people\.69 The sheer number of people involved complicates

decisionmaking, cooperation and coordination\.70 Mechanisms for cooperation or coordination may be scale\-dependent, and new institutions may be required to meet these functions as social networks grow so large\.71 Changes in scale can undermine cooperation and impede consensus\.72

Digital social media provide new ways for groups to interact, find common ground and even organize into movements, but recent advances in digital communications technology have also been disruptive

“

to our social networks, more so than communications advances in the past

- *Changes in structure\. *The structure of human social networks has changed\. A large population com\- bined with technology that connects otherwise disparate groups allows for network structures that were not previously possible\. Where humans had social connections with at most a few hundred others in the past, online media platforms now connect much larger networks of people to one another, as do traditional media sources\. Positive aspects of these networks include the greater possibility of collaboration across borders, the diffusion of scientific ideas and expansion of the networks of those who may otherwise be isolated\. However, some features of these networks, such as long ties and inequality of influence, can facilitate harm\.73 For instance, these networks can foster echo chambers and spread misleading or inaccu\- rate information\.
- *Information fidelity\. *New communications tech\- nology allows for information to be transmitted without decay or noise across several degrees of separation\.74 This makes it easy for false and misleading information to spread fast and widely\. Rapid information flows may overwhelm cogni\- tive processes and lead to less accurate decisions\.75 Because information is cheaper to produce and dis\- tribute, low quality information can spread more easily\.
- *Algorithmic decisionmaking\. *Algorithms are widely used to filter, curate and display information on\- line\. When designed to share information based on user preferences and usage patterns, they work as feedback loops and drive new content exposures

<a id="_bookmark86"></a>__Box 4\.3 Advances in digital communications risk destabilizing societies__

Our species has enjoyed a comparatively stable existence for more than 100,000 years\. Humans lived and spread in loosely connected hunter\-gatherer groups numbering in the tens or low hundreds\. Our biology at that time was not fundamentally different from what it is today, exhibiting rich cultural features such as tool use, social bonds, language, intergroup conflict, art and knowledge sharing\.

The stability of our species, by almost any measure, changed dramatically with the first agricultural revolution 12,000 years ago\. Growing crops and raising animals led many hunter\-gather groups to abandon a mobile lifestyle to form settlements\. Organized labour distribution allowed larger groups to coexist in a given geographic area\. Convert\- ing land for agricultural use provided nutrition to support rapid population growth\. Further technological advances fundamentally altered how most humans interact\. Writing, for instance, opened the potential for ledgers, economies, codified laws and sequestering of wealth\. The printing press enabled large\-scale distribution of information by those able to afford the upfront production costs\.

The Industrial Revolution enabled us to extract and convert natural resources at a dramatically faster pace\. Pho\- tography, radio, telephony, powered transit and television fostered communication across vast spaces at high speed\. These advances caused subsequent generations to bear less and less similarity to previous ones\. Although technol\- ogy has brought us many things, stability is not among them\.

Discussions of digital communications technology, from social media and search engines to artificial intelligence and cryptocurrency, often occur against this backdrop\. Scholars, technologists, politicians and lay people often argue that the internet is simply our generation’s printing press\. Harms are seen as mere growing pains and a far cry from existential\. Our continuing existence is held up as evidence of a collective behavioural invisible hand that will guide us forward much as it brought us here\.

However, there are reasons to believe that digital communication technologies today are both quantitatively and qualitatively distinct from past advances\. Engineering decisions that reshape our society can now be deployed in\- stantaneously and without oversight to billions of users, dramatically outpacing historical adoption timelines and creating novel challenges for evidence\-based regulation\. Further differentiating current advances from past ones, modern communication technology leverages vast datasets and complex algorithms to couple social systems to technological ones\.

Most important, past technological advances have not produced stable social dynamics, particularly in our interac\- tions with the natural world\. Digital communications technology, while nascent, has more potential than any past advance to alter social dynamics\. Given the precarious state of our natural world and global inequalities, disruptions that bring about further instability are existential threats for many\.

that become more extreme over time\.76 Given people’s tendency to seek friendly social environ\- ments, algorithmic feedback may narrow the infor\- mation and networks that users are exposed to: so they can induce biases in perceived reality and con\- tribute to polarization\.77 The algorithms that online media platforms use are typically proprietary, and there is limited transparency in how algorithmic decisions for information flows might be altering human collective behaviour\.78

__*Disruptive changes in information systems can compromise public deliberation*__

The changes described above are altering processes of public deliberation\. More information and larger

networks are not unequivocally empowering\. Along\- side benign or socially beneficial information flows, unreliable and unverified information can also be transmitted with ease through today’s social net\- works\. One area of concern is the proliferation of mis\- information\.79 Online spaces have become hotbeds of politically motivated misinformation, with nega\- tive effects on social dynamics and processes, such as elections80 and treatment of minorities\.81 While misinformation itself is not a new phenomenon, on\- line media have increased the reach, influence and impact of inaccurate information\.82 Misinformation can emerge from a range of actors, including govern\- ments, groups and bots designed to convince people that they are authentic users\.83 The spread of false information can be especially harmful in times of

<a id="_bookmark87"></a>crisis, as clearly demonstrated during the Covid\-19 pandemic\. In many parts of the world, waves of un\- reliable information preceded increases in Covid\-19 infections\.84

Social media might lead people to perceive political divisions to be more extreme,

“

to become more affectively polarized and enclosed in their own views and to have hostile or negative discourse about

others be rewarded or reinforced through increased engagement in social media

Human cognition can facilitate the spread and influence of misinformation\. In contrast to mod\- els of rational choice, people routinely rely on men\- tal shortcuts to bypass some of the information they encounter when making decisions \(see chapter 3\)\.85 Heuristics allow people to reduce the complexity of these judgments to a more manageable scale\. It is in conjunction with people’s cognitive and behavioural tendencies that today’s advanced communications technologies can strain how societies process infor\- mation and form beliefs\. For instance, that fake posts spread wider and faster than truthful news online has been attributed to humans being more likely to spread fake information rather than to those outcomes being an artefact of algorithmic choices\.86 People tend to turn towards information that reinforces their exist\- ing beliefs—a manifestation of confirmation bias\. “Repulsion” away from opposing viewpoints is also a powerful motivator\.87

Algorithmic decisionmaking and feedback in on\- line spaces can influence the flow of information in unpredictable, and often opaque, ways\. Some design characteristics of online media platforms can facili\- tate polarization\. Recommendation algorithms can shape how information spreads on social networks, encouraging people to vote against their interests\.88 Research from Twitter’s Machine Learning, Ethics, Transparency and Accountability Team indicated that their content recommendation algorithms ap\- pear to amplify right\-leaning politicians across the majority of countries surveyed\.89 Although they could not identify why the algorithm exhibited this behav\- iour, it is conceivable that such unexpected algorith\- mic behaviour could affect democratic outcomes in ways that external observers cannot evaluate\.

Interactions on social media can increase per\- ceptions of difference\.90 Selective exposure to like\- minded attitudinal content increases polarization by reinforcing existing attitudes\.91 There is evidence of political sorting on social networks: people adjust their online social ties to avoid encountering news from nonpreferred sources, leading to homogenized online networks\.92 Moreover, negative discourse about the out\-group can get positive reinforcements through increased engagement on social media in comparison to language about the in\-group\.93

Put plainly, social media might lead people to per\- ceive political divisions to be more extreme, to be\- come more affectively polarized and enclosed in their own views and to have hostile or negative discourse about others be rewarded or reinforced through in\- creased engagement in social media\. Although social media are certainly not responsible for all polariza\- tion, they have provided a space for new tactics and paths towards misinformation and polarization\.94

Polarization harms public deliberation in uncertain times

As the analysis here shows, uncertainty creates fer\- tile ground for political polarization, with worry\- ing consequences for public deliberation, precisely when societies must come together to tackle emerg\- ing threats\. Polarization is much more than simple differences in preferences or beliefs\. After all, differ\- ences between groups of people need not impede our ability to work together and generate sound policy\. Some differences between people are often benefi\- cial\.95 And holding many different interests, identities and social connections can constrain social fragmen\- tation\. Even where people disagree on ideological grounds or policy issues, they are less likely to expe\- rience political isolation by virtue of their rich social interactions and overlapping identities\.96 When peo\- ple share beliefs across groups, the space for healthy interaction and deliberation increases\.

Rather than a matter of differing preferences or be\- liefs, the polarization documented in many societies today is more pernicious: “the normal multiplicity of differences in the society increasingly align along a single dimension, cross\-cutting differences become reinforcing, and people increasingly perceive and describe politics and society in terms of ‘us’ versus

<a id="_bookmark88"></a>‘them\.’”97 In other words polarization has to do with deepening social divisions between groups, where in\- tergroup relationships become hostile and disharmo\- nious, distrust between groups intensifies, opposing groups tend towards more extreme positions and the scope for cooperation diminishes\.

In many settings polarization is spilling over into spaces that would otherwise have been ones of coex\- istence, such as families and neighbourhoods\.98 When social networks become segregated, groups have limit\- ed information about others’ preferences, diminishing impulses towards cooperation and coordination\. Rath\- er than any differences over values, it is the breakdown in communication between groups that impedes pub\- lic deliberation\.99 Coming to consensus on issues takes longer when opposing groups are homogenized, and deliberation within homogeneous groups tends to lead people to adopt more extreme positions that they oth\- erwise would on their own\.100 Polarization contributes to discontent with democratic systems\. In a polarized society one group \(“us”\) may see the actions of other opposing groups \(“them”\) as impeding its efforts to shape policy within democratic systems\.

Severe polarization can make people blind to the fact that there are strategies where all sides can gain

“

Frustration with democratic processes can be the result, especially where impulses for collaboration have already been weakened by processes of group homogenization\.101 Democratic institutions them\- selves can struggle to accommodate the priorities of deeply polarized groups, resulting in deadlocks and public disaffection\.102 In\-group–out\-group polariza\- tion can become a driving factor in supporting author\- itarian leaders,103 thus putting democratic processes under strain\.104 Accounting for the rise of radical and populist parties, scholars have shown that declining trust in institutions is associated with diminishing support for traditional insider parties\.105 People’s tol\- erance for undemocratic actions increases, creating conditions for democratic decline or even reversal\. There is evidence of the erosion of attitudes towards democracy and peaceful deliberation in high HDI countries associated with human insecurity \(spot\- light 4\.2\)\.106 In national politics polarization advan\- tages leaders that shun negotiation and compromise

and does lasting damage to the norms that underpin democracy, such as tolerance for differing views\.107

The rise in political polarization is occurring in the context of a long\-term, global disaffection with dem\- ocratic practices\.108 The Varieties of Democracy ap\- proach makes an effort to capture this process and argues that there has been a deterioration of critical ingredients of democracy \(figure 4\.5\)\. Freedom of expression is declining in around 35 countries, more than three times the number where it is increasing\. Similarly, deliberation is in decline in more than four times the number of countries where it is improving\. Clean elections, rule of law and freedom of associa\- tion are also in decline in more countries than where they are improving\.

Severe polarization can make people blind to the fact that there are strategies where all sides can gain\. Instead, they may end up behaving as though life is a zero\-sum game\. This dynamic can be self\- reinforcing: “the less they \[*people*\] undertake joint collective actions, the more their perceptions of dif\- ference, and the more likely it is that they will per\- ceive their interests to be zero\-sum\.”109 Dynamics of polarization affect not just how people feel about oth\- ers who think differently but also how people act\. For example, in the United States social distancing be\- haviours, using masks, getting vaccinated and beliefs about risk during the Covid\-19 pandemic correlate with partisan divisions\.110 Polarization also makes in\- ternational cooperation harder\. For example, party polarization has negative consequences for national commitments to international environmental agree\- ments\.111 We risk losing some of the benefits of liv\- ing in plural societies—a diversity of knowledge and ideas as well as decisionmaking that is responsive to as many people and groups as possible\.112

Worryingly, polarization is difficult to reverse when it involves a positive feedback mechanism\. When positive feedback increases \(such as political parties adopting more extreme positions\), polarization can ascend to a tipping point, after which it becomes a self\-reinforcing, runaway process\.113 And once it has set in, polarization is hard to reverse, even in the face of external shocks\.114 The discussion in this chapter explains how polari\- zation may emerge and persist in a context of uncer\- tainty and how the appeal of authoritarian leaders may increase\. But these are not mechanistic and pre\- determined outcomes\. Greater uncertainty does not

have to lead to polarization\. There are multiple exam\- ples in history where uncertainty was faced through broad collaboration\. With uncertainty people can turn to values that go beyond strategic thinking about seeking the pursuit of self\-interest alone\. If there is trust, that value can be solidarity\.

Experimental evidence indicates that uncertainty can affect the morality of individuals\. Participants in experiments appeared less likely to lie and more like\- ly to share resources under uncertainty, reducing the scope for purely strategic self\-interested behaviour\.115 More important, the power of reasoning and public deliberation is not diminished in uncertain times, particularly when the broad notion of capabilities, emphasizing agency and freedoms, is considered\.

Breaking the hold of uncertainty on collective action

Political polarization associated with human insecu\- rity, and the inadequacy of our institutions in times of

change is standing in the way of more decisive joint action to face common challenges\. Despite clear pro\- gress on many fronts, human insecurity is putting people under stress and pulling people apart\. Human insecurity is associated with lower interpersonal trust and tendencies towards political extremism\.

Meanwhile, rapid changes in information systems are a source of added instability in our social sys\- tems\. Many of the challenges of sustaining informa\- tion systems that support democratic deliberation are not new\. After all, the spread of misleading infor\- mation, censorship and other impediments to demo\- cratic debate existed long before the advent of digital communications technologies\. The difference today is that our information systems now operate at such a broad scale that they pose a systemic challenge to public deliberation, just when our ability to act to\- gether to deal with large\-scale societal challenges is so critical\.

Development progress—with achievements in dif\- ferent dimensions of human development—has gone

<a id="_bookmark90"></a>along with institutions that have structured human interactions116 and made that very progress possible\. But as chapter 3 argues, we may be reaching a point of mismatch between the institutions and social configurations that have enabled progress up to now and those required to face new challenges exempli\- fied by the uncertainty complex\.117 The two process\- es contributing to polarization today may reflect this mismatch— of institutions inadequately responding to people’s unsettledness and insecurity and to a rap\- idly changing \(digital\) information context\. How do we break the vicious cycle of increased polarization, the reduced space for collaboration, the multilay\- ered uncertainties? Advancing human development \(in terms of wellbeing and agency, achievements and freedoms\) remains the foundation for shaping the behavioural and institutional changes needed to navigate our uncertain times\. Expanding capabilities provides a way to enhance the diversity of voices in\- volved in public deliberation to this end, to the extent that processes of deliberation allow for the full range people’s beliefs and motivations to be scrutinized and reasoned\.

Polarization impedes public deliberation, thereby working against the cooperation needed to address novel, multilayered uncertainties

“

Polarization impedes public deliberation, thereby working against the cooperation needed to address novel, multilayered uncertainties\. Two critical ele\- ments are deeply interconnected in breaking the hold of uncertainty on collective action\.

First, tackling people’s unsettledness and human insecurity\. Thriving under uncertainty requires human security, overcoming the mismatch between aspiration and achievements\.118 Our ability to im\- plement the many transformations needed today— local, national and global—depends on our ability to agree on what needs to be done, to generate broad social support and then to implement creative policy change amid uncertainty\. Addressing the basic driv\- ers of unsettledness and insecurity in people’s lives is essential\.

Existing strategies for human security need to be upgraded\. An expanded concept of human security for the Anthropocene combines strategies of protec\- tion, empowerment and solidarity \(where solidarity recognizes the interdependence among people and between people and the planet\)\.119 This agenda de\- pends on several actions, and there are some practi\- cal examples, such as strengthening social protection systems with built\-in adaptive capabilities\. Robust so\- cial protection not only allows people to better weath\- er shocks but also helps sustain people’s wellbeing and broad participation in decisionmaking\. In other words effective social protection systems can support agency\. To directly address the spread of polariza\- tion, policies that seek to counter the feedback cycle between inequality and polarization are also crucial\.120 Second, steering the expansion of social networks to advance human development\. It is imperative to acknowledge that the digital world occupies a cen\- tral role in our social interactions and to set principles and norms to guide its expansion, so it favours human flourishing and an equitable and effective collective deliberation\. A hands\-off approach is not enough— there is little to suggest that an information ecosys\- tem organized for narrow private interests \(including boosting engagement, ad sales or short\-term profit\) might organically evolve into a space for free, open and informed collective deliberation\.121 Principles of stewardship, comparable to managing complex eco\- systems, have relevance for strengthening our infor\- mation systems\.122 Within this framework three steps

can be considered:

- Increasing transparency over how companies opt to sort, filter and display information to users\.
- Improving access and equity in leveraging informa\- tion and communications technology\.
- Enhancing our understanding more broadly of how new technologies are shaping public discourse and deliberation\.123

As detailed in the following chapter, new oppor\- tunities for transformation are emerging against a backdrop of rapid technological change and the re\- cent Covid\-19 crisis\. Chapter 6 suggests a way for\- ward, with a framework for action in uncertain times\.

##### Inequality and the structure of political conflict in democracies: A global and historical perspective

__Amory Gethin __*\(Paris School of Economics—École des hautes études en sciences sociales and World Inequality Lab\), *__Clara Martínez\-Toledano __*\(Imperial College London and World Inequality Lab\), *__Thomas Piketty __*\(Paris School of Economics—École des hautes études en sciences sociales and World Inequality Lab\)*

In our new book, *Political Cleavages and Social Ine\- qualities,*1 we investigate where and how class divides emerge and how they interact with other social con\- flicts \(ethnic, regional, generational, gender and the like\)\. In what contexts do we see inequality become politically salient and why? What determines the strength of identity\-based divides, and how do these conflicts interact with the structure of social inequal\- ities? Drawing on a unique set of surveys conducted between 1948 and 2020 in 50 countries on five conti\- nents, our volume sheds new light on these questions

and North American democracies, in other regions there are large variations in the configuration and intensity of class divides\. These variations can often be explained by the relative importance of other di\- mensions of political conflict\. The interaction among class, regional, ethnic, religious, generational, gen\- der and other forms of divides thus plays a key role in determining the ways through which inequalities are politically represented in democracies around the world today\.

and provides a new data source to investigate voting		

behaviours in a global and historical perspective: the World Political Cleavages and Inequality Database \([http://wpid\.world](http://wpid.world/)\)\.

Among the many findings of the book, three interest\- ing facts emerge from the analysis of this new dataset\.

The intensity of class divisions varies widely in contemporary democracies

We document a gradual decoupling of two comple\- mentary measures of social class in many European and North American democracies: income and ed\- ucation\. In the early post–World War II decades the party systems of these democracies were class\-based: social democratic and affiliated parties represented both the low\-education and the low\-income elec\- torates, whereas conservative and affiliated parties

Ethnic diversity is not synonymous with ethnic conflict

Another major finding of our global perspective on political divides is that ethnic and religious conflicts vary widely across countries and over time\. In par\- ticular, more diverse countries are not necessarily those where ethnic or religious conflicts are more intense\. Instead, varieties of political cleavage struc\- tures can be accounted for in part by history, such as the ability of national liberation movements to bring together voters from different origins\. They also have an important socioeconomic component: in democ\- racies where ethnoreligious groups tend to cluster across regions and differ markedly in their standards of living, political parties also tend to reflect ethnic af\- filiations to a greater extent\.

represented both high\-education and high\-income		

voters \(figure S4\.1\.1\)\. These party systems have grad\- ually evolved towards what we can call multi\-elite party systems: social democratic and affiliated parties have become the parties of higher\-educated elites, while conservative and affiliated parties remain the parties of high\-income elites\.

In contrast to the gradual decoupling between in\- come and education that we find in many European

Identity politics take different forms

The large variations in class and sociocultural divides in contemporary democracies point to a more general pattern\. Political cleavages can take multiple forms, depending on the nature of underlying social con\- flicts and on the ability of political parties to embody these conflicts in the democratic arena\.

In European and North American democracies, for instance, the rise of conflicts over immigration and the environment have come together with the decline of class divides and of traditional left\-wing parties, per\- haps because they are perceived as unable to propose convincing redistributive platforms\. It has also coin\- cided with a decline in turnout among low\-income and

lower\-educated voters, pointing to a more general dis\- satisfaction among these voters with the functioning of democracy\. Nonetheless, the shift to identity poli\- tics observed in many democracies today is neither in\- evitable nor generalized\. In several countries outside Europe and North America the class\-based dimension of political conflicts has intensified in recent decades\.

##### Support for democracy under strain: Evidence from very high Human Development Index countries

Democratic institutions are means to deliver on collective choices\. Uncertainty can affect this role, through polarization, which in turn can affect beliefs about democratic institutions\. Overall, support for democracy is high globally\. But the share of people considering democracy very important is sensitive to the perceptions of human insecurity, particularly in very high Human Development Index \(HDI\) coun\- tries and among high\-income groups \(figure S4\.2\.1, left panel\)\. Moreover, people’s justification of violence as a political tool also appears highly connected with human insecurity, in particular among high\-income

segments \(figure S4\.2\.1, right panel\)\.1 Among high\- income groups, an insecure person is more than twice as likely to justify violence or not consider democracy very important than a secure person\. These results in\- dicate a potentially destabilizing dynamic of negative attitudes towards cooperation at the top\. This trend should be of concern, considering that people affected by high insecurity account for more than 40 percent of the population in very high HDI countries \(even be\- fore the Covid\-19 pandemic\)\.

Why are people in higher HDI countries more sen\- sitive to human insecurity \(measured by attitudes and

perceptions\)?2 People near the top of the HDI gener\- ally enjoy greater human security than those living in lower HDI settings\. And because people near the top of the HDI have known greater human security, they are likely to feel “entitled” to it and therefore per\- ceive insecurity as a loss\. This may be a reason why people in higher HDI countries derive more distress from human insecurity\.3

The feeling of uncertainty across HDI categories can also be affected by the mismatch between expec\- tations and reality: people suffering insecurity in very high HDI countries and high\-income countries are

more likely to experience the cognitive dissonance of development\-with\-insecurity: income, a meas\- ure of worth and success that often guides people’s behaviour and incentives, cannot in these extreme cases protect against threats, as could be typically expected\. As market\-based mechanisms of security and regular state\-based policies struggle to deliver, authoritarian approaches might become attractive, consistent with the earlier discussion on the appeal of dominant\-type leaders\.

1. All differences between people perceiving very high human insecurity and people perceiving low human insecurity are statistically significant at the 1 percent level\.
2. The index of perceived insecurity is built using a linear aggregation of in\- security threats and cannot account for their subjective impact on people\. See UNDP \(2022b\)\.
3. The higher sensitivity of wealthier groups to human insecurity is consistent with the existence of endowment effects \(Thaler 1980\)—people living in a context of high human security \(both on an objective and subjective basis\) will tend to value more the benefits of a high human security environment

—and with loss aversion \(Tversky and Kahneman 1991, p\. 1047\)—“losses \(outcomes below the reference status\) loom larger than corresponding gains \(outcomes above the reference state\)\.” In line with the idea that the loss aversion theory can be context specific \(Gal and Rucker 2018\), the text elaborates further about the meaning of loss in a context of a very high HDI country\.

# Advancing human development in uncertain times

PART II — SHAPING OUR FUTURE IN A TRANSFORMING WORLD 

<a id="_bookmark91"></a>__CHAPTER 5__

Advancing human development in uncertain times

Uncertainty need not be paralyzing\. In fact,

it presents opportunities to test the fences of conventional thinking and to pursue reimagined futures\.

What do those opportunities look like today? How big are they?

As this chapter argues: huge\.

Among the many things the Covid\-19 pandemic

broke open was our imaginations, from revolutionary vaccines to unprecedented fiscal and monetary

interventions\. Rapidly evolving technologies, such as artificial intelligence and synthetic biology, and frontier ones, such as nuclear fusion, could usher in a new era of prosperity for people and planet\.

Opportunities abound\. It is up to us to steer them towards human development\.

158	HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2021/2022 

<a id="_bookmark92"></a>Uncertainty need not lead to negative outcomes\. A context of uncertainty and change can also alter the reference for what is possible or desirable, opening new opportunities to expand human development along the four aspects of capabilities highlighted in chapter 3: wellbeing achievements \(typically the dominant focus of assessments of progress and pol\- icies\), wellbeing freedoms, agency freedoms and agency achievements\.

Transformational change happens against the backdrop of the uncertainties discussed in part I\. Some of the implications associated with climate change are daunting, as the most recent Intergovern\- mental Panel on Climate Change assessments have highlighted\.1 But the ability of societies to respond is not predetermined\. A recent model of human be\- haviour that looked at the interactions among social, political, economic, technical and climate systems found that interactions at the individual, communi\- ty, national and global scales could lead to substantial mitigation action\.2 In fact, the reality of the Anthro\- pocene is that human agency signals hope to con\- sciously manage planetary ecosystems in a way that eases planetary pressures\.3

This chapter calls attention to the potential for ex\- panding human development in uncertain times\. It argues that such an expansion can be leveraged in part precisely because uncertain times provide a con\- text where individuals and society see more funda\- mental changes as possible or required\. Uncertainty itself can be a source of knowledge to be mobilized to act differently,4 something that empowers indi\- viduals and societies to adopt fundamental changes in choices,5 that leads people to act according to new moral codes6 and that can enhance cooperation when it gives more salience to thinking about the future\.7 It has even been suggested that the greatest source of political legitimacy may need to evolve beyond pro\- cess legitimacy \(complying with procedures that link people’s aspirations and preferences to political de\- cisions\) and substantive legitimacy \(delivering out\- comes that matter to people\)\. It can also come from promissory legitimacy \(justifying decisions and per\- suading others to act based on claims about what the future will hold\)\.8 With democracy, uncertainty an\- nounces the freedom to choose\. By institutionalizing an iterative and evolving configuration of winners and losers, uncertainty over political outcomes keeps

many different possibilities open, thereby supporting pluralism and participation\.9 Uncertainty can thus help tap into people’s energy and appetite for change\. Uncertainty forces us to make choices—between sticking to known paths and exploring new ones, between yielding to paralysis and polarization or tackling them head on\.10 Both bleaker and more op\- timistic scenarios may seem plausible, but the paths are open and will be shaped by choices\. Multiple nar\- ratives are being discussed and debated about what the future holds,11 and this diversity can be mobilized to enable people to cooperate\.12 When old ways of doing things seem to no longer work and develop\- ment pathways seem less obvious than in the past, the opportunities for rethinking ideas and practices open up\.13 Uncertainty can provide fertile ground for experimentation, innovation and purposeful trans\- formation\.14 In other words, it is possible to embrace uncertainty and not be paralyzed by it\.15 We can do much today to ensure human thriving and flourish\-

ing, even in times of crisis and turbulence\.

It is possible to embrace uncertainty and not be paralyzed by it\. We can do much today to ensure human thriving and flourishing, even in times of crisis and turbulence

“

This chapter considers some of those possibilities\. It explores the example offered by technological ad\- vances, arguing that the context of uncertainty pro\- vides a space for steering technological progress in ways that advance human development\. It also shows that times of crisis can alter the horizon of what is possible\. Even amid significant failures, the Covid\-19 pandemic has changed our reference points for what we can achieve in many aspects of life\. These are ex\- amples of the new possibilities in today’s uncertain world\.

Technological innovation opens new possibilities

Technological advances have been behind vast im\- provements in human life and flourishing\. They have been the engine of economic growth—powering the Industrial Revolution, building cities and allowing movement of people and goods\. The printing press and photography have expanded human knowledge\.

<a id="_bookmark93"></a>Communication technologies have linked people across vast distances, allowed for rapid dissemina\- tion of information and expanded our social connec\- tions in large\-scale networks\. Numerous innovations in health, from anaesthetics to vaccines, have al\- lowed us to live longer and healthier lives\.

However, technological innovation does not hap\- pen in a vacuum, nor does it have a life of its own: technology is us\. Our social, economic and political choices—about where innovation can be directed, to what priorities and to serve which people—determine how technology changes and how innovations ad\- vance human development\. Consider the sobering case of vaccine deployment during the Covid\-19 pan\- demic\. Advances in science and manufacturing al\- lowed for multiple, highly effective vaccines against Covid\-19 to be developed in record time, in a remark\- able feat of modern science\. But amid a global fail\- ure to share vaccines equitably, wide disparities have emerged: by June 2022 less than 15 percent of people in low\-income countries had received a full protocol of Covid\-19 vaccines, compared with nearly 75 per\- cent of people in high\-income countries\.16 Unequal access to lifesaving vaccines has had a tragic toll on human lives and wellbeing\.

Our social, economic and political choices

“

—about where innovation can be directed, to what priorities and to serve which people— determine how technology changes and how innovations advance human development

This startling disparity in vaccine access reflects in part patterns in the diffusion of technological in\- novations\. The share of the population that benefits is small when a new technology is introduced; then typically the share grows slowly at first, then increas\- es very quickly after a threshold is reached and then slows down as the share of the population with ac\- cess approaches 100 percent—in what is well known in technology diffusion studies as an S curve\. De\- pending on the innovation at stake, often those with higher income, power and social status benefit from technological advancements first\. This pattern is well documented, in particular, for health innovations,17 in part because initial adopters have better access to information\.18 Disparities in health outcomes have been found to increase for diseases with better tools

for prevention and treatment, because people with more resources are better able to use new knowl\- edge\.19 As such, an acceleration in new health\-related technology can worsen health gradients within and between countries for a time, even as it eventually drives improvements at large\.20 In terms of Covid\-19 vaccines, while the gap between richer and poorer countries has decreased over time, there is still a long way to go\.21

The initial stage of the technological diffusion process— of remarkable improvements alongside widening gaps—is eventually closed, not only as tech\- nological innovations become more affordable, but also as complementary changes in economic and so\- cial arrangements foster both greater benefits and lower prices due to further diffusion\.22 At the same time, those excluded as the technology diffuses to a larger and larger share of the population are doubly disadvantaged, in that not only do they lack the ben\- efits of the innovation, but they are also left outside what is increasingly the norm\. The ongoing digital revolution is an example, promising to vastly improve the world’s production possibilities but risking leav\- ing a substantial proportion of people excluded and ultimately worse off if insufficient attention is paid to those exclusions\.23

Past technological advances have generated great disruptions alongside opportunities and deep anxi\- eties about the future, as well as the promise of pro\- gress to come\. Rapid technological change is part of the uncertainty complex gripping the world today\. New technologies are upending our economies and societies, and many aspects of our social systems will need to adjust before the vast potential of tech\- nological innovation can advance human develop\- ment\. As argued in the 2019 Human Development Report, these adjustments must unequivocally pay attention to inequalities if another great divergence is to be avoided\.24 The shift from concentrated ac\- cess and wide inequality to convergence over time depends on social and political choices\. Amid tech\- nological change as rapid and destabilizing as we are seeing today, the need for institutional and behav\- ioural transformation becomes not only more salient but also necessary and actionable\. Periods of turbu\- lence have prompted radical new policies in the past: in Britain the Industrial Revolution saw far\-reach\- ing interventions to improve labour and working

<a id="_bookmark94"></a>conditions \(including regulating work hours and taxing incomes\), which helped convert the structur\- al change in the economy into improved opportunity and wellbeing\.25

The initial stages of diffusion are characterized by growing inequality in access and typically also so\- cial dislocation\. But this context is an opportunity for action: the choices made at this stage determine the trajectory to come\. Expanding human development becomes even more important at this stage, with the concern for inequalities at the centre, implying that uncertain times need not be seen as an impediment to action; rather, they provide a context in which new possibilities for action emerge\.

Many of today’s hopes for positive transformational change rely on technological innovations\. New tech\- nologies have helped deliver rapid advances in human development\. For instance, in health, antibiotics and vaccines vastly improved life expectancy in just a few decades in Africa, Asia, and Latin America; in Europe the same improvement took well over a century, from the early 1800s, when such technology did not exist\.26 More recent technological advances have been crucial for curbing human\-induced pressures on the planet

—enabling more efficient land use, more sustainable food systems and a transition away from fossil fuels\. Technological changes affect human capabilities in multiple ways: they not only expand people’s ability to do more things \(as an enabler\), but they also affect our social context and people’s agency\.27 Innovation is more than new inventions or machines; it is about new ideas for doing things and taking advantage of exist\- ing resources to make those ideas come to fruition\. In this respect innovation is linked to agency—people’s ability to act on their values, ideas and priorities\. It is a broad process of transformation, where human initi\- ative and creativity interact with social, economic and political choices\.

Technological advances are offering transformative potential

Today, several developments in science and tech\- nology signal the potential for far\-reaching trans\- formation\. There have been major developments in computing, biology and energy, as discussed in chapter 1\. These advances are occurring in what has

been described as the exponential age, fostered by remarkable improvements in computing power and connections across people and machines\.28 Expo\- nential development in new technologies is not sim\- ply about individual inventions—it is the result of several new technologies developing in parallel and nourishing one another\.29 In digital technologies our capacity to generate innovations on the back of old or existing technologies has greatly expanded\. Many important technologies today are standardized and interoperable30—that is, made compatible with other technologies by design\. The internet is based on standard web protocols, and much modern soft\- ware development relies on modular, standard code blocks\. These conditions help make breakthrough in\- novations possible\.

Disruptive change in major technological sectors has the potential to dramatically alter societies and economies

“

Economic and political conditions are an important part of this picture\. The availability of markets for new goods and services, facilitated by trade and glo\- balization, has helped new technologies diffuse wide\- ly\. This has enabled us to engage in learning by doing: more production allows us to learn how to further im\- prove the production process\. This learning effect is an essential driver behind the exponential develop\- ment of solar power technology\.31 Our networks for sharing information are also larger and more com\- plex than ever, facilitating flows of data, ideas and know\-how\. Consider some factors that made Covid\- 19 vaccines possible, such as global scientific collabo\- ration, open data sharing and the release of the latest research on preprint servers—all capabilities based on information networks\.32 Spurred by the Covid\-19 crisis, advances in mRNA vaccine technology are now opening new possibilities for controlling disease\.33

Disruptive change in major technological sectors has the potential to dramatically alter societies and economies\. Many new technologies are general pur\- pose, with applications beyond a single sector\. Gen\- eral purpose technologies are transformative because they create new products and processes and new ways of organizing economic activity\. The general\- purpose technologies of today include new forms of computing \(such as artificial intelligence\), among

<a id="_bookmark95"></a>many others, with a dizzying array of applications for advancing human development\. The following sections consider some of the possibilities offered by technological advances in energy, computing and biology\.

That even the most beneficial advances often gen\- erate negative consequences only heightens the importance of purposefully managing technolog\- ical disruption\. Technological change is far from deterministic—the related risks and impacts and the prospects for positive transformation are all ulti\- mately shaped by social and political choices\. Even as rapid technological change fosters uncertainty, it also opens space for action\. There is enormous potential to be realized, and with the right policies and actions in place \(as discussed in depth in chapter 6\), the fu\- ture should be one of remarkable gains for human development\.

__*Renewable energy technologies are getting better and cheaper*__

Making progress on clean energy is essential for breaking the patterns of human wellbeing improve\- ments generating planetary pressures\. Because en\- ergy is so crucial to overall human development, energy consumption is unlikely to ease in the near future, particularly in developing countries\. So, in the absence of technological advancements towards plentiful clean energy, there are few viable paths to mitigating planetary pressures\.

On the technological front there are remarkable positive signals both as outcomes and as processes\. New capacity additions were dominated by renew\- able energy, accounting for 72 percent of additions worldwide in 2019\.34 The costs of renewable energy technology and energy storage have declined dramat\- ically in recent years\. The price of utility\-scale solar photovoltaics dropped by 89 percent from 2009 to 2019 \(figure 5\.1\)\.35 The price of lithium\-ion batteries has fallen by 97 percent since their commercial intro\- duction in 1991\.36 Maturing technology contributes to cost and price reductions\. For solar power tech\- nology, installed capacity has increased exponential\- ly, accompanied by exponential declines in the cost of solar modules\.37 Since the 1970s the unit costs of solar photovoltaics have fallen by 24 percent each time the cumulative installed capacity has doubled\.

The equivalent learning rate for lithium\-ion batteries has been around 20 percent\.38 Other energy storage technologies have followed similarly steep learning curves\.39 Batteries are also becoming smaller and lighter\. Between 1991 and 2018 the energy density of lithium\-ion batteries rose 3\.4\-fold\.40 The dramat\- ic cost reductions in renewable energy technologies have consistently exceeded expectations: contra\- ry to the projected average annual cost reduction of

2\.6 percent between 2010 and 2020 \(based on 2,905 global energy\-economy models\), solar photovoltaics costs declined by 15 percent a year over the same pe\- riod \(figure 5\.2\)\.41

There have been major breakthroughs in nuclear fusion\. Leveraging nuclear fusion’s enormous poten\- tial will require substantial innovations before it can be deployed at scale\. This transition will take time, but recent developments provide some grounds for optimism\. There have been important advanc\- es in some nuclear fusion experiments, and at least three may soon generate energy gain factors \(the ratio of fusion power to externally applied heating power\) greater than 1—the National Ignition Facil\- ity and SPARC are expected to do so in the 2020s, and ITER by 2040\.42 In February 2022 scientists at the Joint European Torus generated more than dou\- ble the previous record for energy generated in a fu\- sion reaction, a major step towards nuclear fusion becoming a viable clean energy source\.43 There are also signs of new technologies interacting in ways that can accelerate progress\. Machine learning tech\- niques are being used in the tokamak configuration \(a form of magnetic confinement used in nuclear fu\- sion research\)\.44

Making progress on clean energy is essential for breaking the patterns of human wellbeing improvements generating planetary pressures

“

But the path forward is likely to be volatile in the context of uncertainty that we confront today\. Dur\- ing the Covid\-19 pandemic progress in clean energy innovation may have been affected by pressures on public and private budgets, creating a riskier environ\- ment for clean energy venture capital and disrupting global supply chains\. Global carbon dioxide emis\- sions declined by 5\.8 percent in 2020, as the pandem\- ic affected demand for oil and coal, but rebounded by

opportunities for applying AI are in automation that augments—rather than replaces—demand for human tasks across various sectors of the economy\. AI\-based systems are driving major technological develop\- ments in several applications, such as autonomous vehicles, medical diagnosis and inventory manage\- ment, to name a few\.50 This means that some tasks can be performed by machines, but there is little evidence that machines can replace whole occupa\- tions\.51 Instead, applications for machine learning \(a subset of AI\) that have exploded in numerous fields are opening an array of new possibilities for advanc\- ing human wellbeing\. For climate change, machine learning is aiding in predicting disasters and model\- ling climate change impacts, among many other ap\- plications\. In healthcare, machine learning is offering

new ways to detect and diagnose disease\.52 Machine learning applications have the potential to improve education outcomes through individualized learning techniques and accessibility applications\.53

Augmenting what humans can achieve by using AI in a complementary way rather than substitut\- ing what humans can do offers enormous promise— what people can achieve with these machines can be greater than what people might achieve without them \(figure 5\.3\)\. AI applications can supplement human cognitive tasks\. For instance, there is evidence of AI’s potential for supporting human decisionmaking through teaching people cognitive strategies\.54 By augmenting the process of technological invention, AI applications could vastly increase the rate at which human capacities further expand\.55

One of the most widely discussed impacts of AI relates to its effects on the world of work\. The pos\- sibility of labour displacement is a source of anxie\- ty, as it has been in previous waves of automation\.56 AI\-induced labour displacement could exacerbate inequality, both within and between countries\.57 But AI also offers labour\-enhancing potential\.58 When machines replace labour, workers’ bargaining power and influence diminish; in contrast, when AI aug\- ments human activity, people remain important for value creation and continue to wield power and in\- fluence\. There is some evidence that the augmen\- tation effects of introducing AI can outweigh the effects of automation, but this requires appropri\- ate incentives\.59 Moreover, introducing technology can generate new tasks and activities that demand human labour\.60 Most jobs performed today came into being in part through the task\-creating effects of new technologies: in the United States around 60 percent of people are now employed in occu\- pations that did not exist in 1940\.61 Expanding AI into the world of work could similarly generate new tasks, new occupations and new industries altogether\.

__*Harnessing synthetic biology*__

Advances on several fronts are now propelling what has been described the Synthetic Age, where biolog\- ical systems can be redesigned and re\-engineered for a variety of useful purposes\.62 Synthetic biology builds on advances in multiple fields over the past decade, including dramatic declines in the cost of DNA sequencing and synthesis, the development of sophisticated gene editing tools such as CRISPR and high\-powered computational tools\.63

Redesigning organisms to have new abilities could have numerous applications in health, agriculture, manufacturing and ecosystem management\. Synthet\- ic biology is supporting new advances in medicine— for treating cancer,64 improving cell\-based and gene therapies65 and developing new drugs\.66 In agriculture there are now possibilities for engineering nitrogen fix\- ation in crops and increasing crop resistance to pests and pathogens\.67 Potential applications of synthetic biology in managing the environment include break\- ing down pollutants68 and supporting biodiversity and habitat restoration\.69 There is also potential for devel\- oping synthetic alternatives to fossil fuels\.70

<a id="_bookmark99"></a>Times of change come with space for purposeful intervention

In addition to great opportunities, fast\-changing technologies also create new challenges: potential for misuse, thorny political and ethical issues, and risks from unintended and even unknown consequences\. For instance, synthetic biology applications such as human genome editing involve urgent ethical ques\- tions\.71 Some of the challenges introduced by syn\- thetic biology applications are unprecedented in nature, such as the novel risks of introducing artificial life forms\. Expanding AI applications also introduces considerable risks\. AI and digitization more broad\- ly can contribute to the concentration of wealth and market power\.72 Beyond the impact in some sectors of the economy, using AI to assist human judgement and predictions in several domains \(health, educa\- tion and governance to name a few\) introduces new risks, including of algorithmic bias and discrimina\- tion \(see chapters 1 and 2\)\.73

Given the speed at which technological advances are unfolding, there is the risk that, without appropriate incentives

“

and regulation, new problems might accumulate just as rapidly while long\- standing ones are further exacerbated

The potential of these technologies, coupled with the new challenges they pose, increases the impor\- tance of purposefully steering technological progress in ways that expand human capabilities\. Indeed, given the speed at which technological advances are unfolding, there is the risk that, without appropriate incentives and regulation, new problems might accu\- mulate just as rapidly while long\-standing ones \(such as inequalities\) are further exacerbated\. Many new technological advances reflect what has been consid\- ered an era where societal implications are exceed\- ingly complex and require sophisticated governance and policymaking\.74 New social and ethical ques\- tions might unfold faster than appropriate responses can be formed\.75 Moreover, the Covid\-19 pandem\- ic has generated an enormous setback for human development progress\. It is in this context that the double\-edged sword of technological change must be wielded carefully\.

These conditions highlight the importance of pur\- posefully advancing the full potential of new technol\- ogies for human development\. For instance, rather than leaving the evolution of new technologies up to markets or to the narrow incentives of a few actors alone, actively steering new technologies towards expanding human capacities is essential\. Policy and regulatory interventions are important in this respect, as is a broader evolution of norms for responsible in\- novation and avoiding harm\. Opening spaces for broad deliberation and overcoming the gulf between technical and social debates on new advances will be essential for advancing the human development po\- tential of the disruptive new technologies\.76

A context of uncertainty can provide the conditions in which such actions become possible\. Navigating our current reality will require new ways of thinking\. In these conditions opportunities emerge to rethink old ideas and practices and to experiment with dif\- ferent ways of doing things\. For instance, it has been suggested that managing technological disruption today demands rethinking competition policy and antitrust regulation\.77 Things that once appeared im\- possible or infeasible are becoming possible in gov\- ernance, science, technology and innovation\. Indeed, as the next section discusses, times of crisis can alter our reference points for what we can achieve—and open new avenues for action in uncertain times\.

The Covid\-19 pandemic:

A window into a new reality

The Covid\-19 pandemic has exerted a vast human toll, not only through loss of life but also through long\-term damage to economies and communities\. It is the greatest global crisis in human development since World War II\. Harmonized information since 1950 for income per capita and life expectancy shows the magnitude of the crisis and its global character in historical perspective \(figure 5\.4\): in 2020, 85 percent of countries experienced a decline in income per cap\- ita, and 70 percent of countries and territories faced a reduction in life expectancy at birth\. The comparison of income and life expectancy also reminds us of the importance of looking beyond income: despite signif\- icant economic recovery in 2021, the health crisis in\- tensified, with two\-thirds of countries recording even further reductions in life expectancy at birth\.

The Covid\-19\-Adjusted Human Development Index quantifies the depth of the crisis from a multi\- dimensional perspective\. The index retains the standard Human Development Index \(HDI\) dimen\- sions but modifies the expected years of schooling indicator to reflect the effects of school closures and the availability of online learning on effective at\- tendance rates\.78 The Covid\-19 pandemic touched nearly every person in the world, with all regions facing declines \(figure 5\.5\)\. In 2020 the world ex\- perienced a loss in Covid\-19\-adjusted HDI value equivalent to more than one\-fifth of the progress from 1990 to 2019\. Latin America and the Caribbe\- an was the most affected region, losing in one year the equivalent of 30 percent of its pre\-Covid\-19 pro\- gress since 1990\.

In 2021 there was a recovery, but it was partial and uneven\. For very high HDI countries the 2020

Covid\-19\-adjusted HDI shock was not as large as across other country groups, but it was more sus\- tained, with a slow recovery in 2021\.

Crises on such a large scale hold up a mirror to so\- cieties\. Covid\-19 has laid bare the vast prepandemic disparities in people’s ability to cope with shocks to access healthcare and to rebuild from loss\. The pan\- demic has exposed the fragilities in global coordi\- nation mechanisms in pandemic preparedness and response\. The Independent Panel for Pandemic Pre\- paredness and Response found “gaps and failings at every critical juncture of preparedness”: contain\- ment measures that were too slow, a lack of coordi\- nated global leadership, emergency funding that took too long to materialize, and large holes in social protection systems\.79 The unequal access to lifesav\- ing Covid\-19 vaccines demonstrated a tragic failure of global solidarity\.80 These failures played a role in

the pandemic’s disproportionate impacts on people around the world\.

Yet, even as crises mirror weaknesses and injus\-

technological innovation, delivering inclusive social protection and changing social norms\.

tice, the current crisis also shows us that there are		

opportunities\. Wars, pandemics and disasters can trigger far\-reaching change\. The 1918 flu pandemic helped spur investments in medicine in some coun\- tries, and the bubonic plague triggered efforts to im\- prove sanitation and working conditions\.81 At other times shocks have fostered repressive or harmful policies or not resulted in change\.82 Opportunities for positive transformations are context\-specific and far from inevitable \(box 5\.1\)\. The next section suggests that amid significant collective failures the world’s response to the pandemic offers new possibilities for transformation\. In our response to Covid\-19 are new reference points for what we can achieve in times of crisis—triggering breakthrough

New reference points for technological breakthroughs

Less than two years after the novel coronavirus strain was identified, multiple highly effective vaccines against Covid\-19 were deployed around the world\.83 The availability of vaccines for Covid\-19 was a cru\- cial turning point\. The speed of developing these vaccines—just 11 months after the SARS\-CoV\-2 se\- quence was published—is a remarkable achievement\. This outcome was made possible in part by years of scientific work, including three decades of prior re\- search into RNA\-based vaccines, now deployed for the first time to tackle Covid\-19\. The history of mRNA vaccine development starts in the 1960s\.84 But only

<a id="_bookmark102"></a>__Box 5\.1 The Covid\-19 pandemic as an opportunity? A call for a contextual approach__

Do shocks create opportunities for policy change? How can the Covid\-19 pandemic help ensure that in the future most of the population has access to clean water, sanitation, healthcare, school services and other social benefits as a matter of right? These questions have surfaced in the aftermath of a pandemic that upended all dimensions of everyday life\. Progressive policymakers, social activists and international organizations have identified the current crisis as an opportunity to promote radical policy change\.

An important body of research identifies shocks as triggers for policy change\. Pandemics have also generated opportunities for change as early as the 14th century, contributing to the growth of public institutions and the modern state\.1 The extent to which pandemics have triggered opportunities for inclusionary change has depended at least in part on the role of ideas—including scientific ideas—and how they have shaped the narratives regarding policy responses\. Each narrative is a story about a problem and its sometimes\-obvious solution\.2

Analytic frameworks that move beyond grand proclamations about how shocks enhance opportunities for inclusive social policies can be useful\. To determine whether such policies have created longer term opportunities, we propose focusing on three key variables\. First are the incentives that the policy tools themselves create\.3 Second are the responses to shocks that can also modify the distribution of power among state actors\. Third are the narratives that are particularly important as a mechanism for change—one that deserves special attention here\. In this way ideas are a power resource to define what the problem subject to state intervention is, frame possible and desirable outcomes and lead policy implementation\.4

Opportunities are context\-specific and revolve around the combination of narratives, policy tools and pro\-equity state actors\. Take the emergency cash transfers under the Bono Proteger programme, which buffered the sudden loss of income in Costa Rica\. The pandemic, along with high uncertainty and fear of social unrest, lifted constraints and made space to implement new policy measures\. The programme empowered state entities focused on advanc\- ing social goals and created openings for new narratives and policy tools\.5 A second lesson is that the pandemic may leave as many challenges as opportunities when narratives of austerity, including the claim that more taxes are not politically possible or even desirable, take hold\.

This reminds us of the power of the idea that states should live within their means, which often also implies that they should avoid increasing taxes as much as possible\. Austerity is as much a scientific idea as it is a moral impera\- tive linked to moderation and sacrifice\.6 It alters the relationship between the state and citizens and has become a powerful tool against serious attempts towards redistribution\.7 In recent decades, austerity has become appealing for conservative political actors critical of the welfare state, because it is “politically more expedient to argue that the government lives above its means than to directly attack the poor\.”8

To further advance and fight this dominant narrative, much needs to change\. The combination of state weaknesses and pro\-status quo actors \(such as the economic elites\) that ended up inhibiting rapid use of the opportunities cre\- ated to expand inclusive social policy should be analysed further\.

in 1993 was the first vaccine tested for influenza in mice\. Commercial research and development started only in the late 1990s, with the US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency financing a large part of the research\. This long history of development made possible vaccine development from when the pan\- demic started\.

Even as these advances in vaccine technology built off a pre\-existing foundation, the Covid\-19

emergency injected an unparalleled sense of urgency into scientific work, producing a systemic shift in sup\- ply and demand\. Addressing the pandemic through vaccination became a mission, and vaccine supply chains emerged\.85 Moreover, thanks to the steady reduction of DNA sequencing time, many coun\- tries could receive current information on prevailing strains of the virus and to act accordingly\. Publication pipelines worked overtime to keep up with the rapidly

<a id="_bookmark103"></a>emerging research\.86 The rate of Covid\-19\-related therapies in research pipelines and the academic pub\- lication rate of Covid\-19 articles exceeded that of re\- cent Ebola, Zika and H1N1 crises by at least an order of magnitude\.87

The success of vaccine development shows that governments, industry and academia can work to\- gether to great effect in a crisis\. Regulatory processes were deployed to support the acceleration of clini\- cal development, trials and emergency use author\- ization\. Governments provided large investments in manufacturing capacity and in supporting private research and development\. Manufacturing pipelines were developed alongside clinical trials to allow for rapid scale\-up\. Government investments helped sup\- port development of several potential vaccine can\- didates, increasing the odds that at least a few might be successful\. The United States and Germany were the largest investors in vaccine research and develop\- ment, providing about $2 billion and $1\.5 billion re\- spectively to pharmaceutical companies\.88 Covid\-19 also propelled major technological advances in our ability to develop vaccines for future diseases: novel RNA technology appears set to permanently trans\- form how vaccines can be developed and manufac\- tured in the future\.89

New reference points for social protection and economic policy

In the more than two years since the SARS\-CoV\-2 virus was first identified, governments have adopted new and unprecedented policy measures to protect vulnerable populations and national economies from lasting damage\.90

Instruments of economic policy have been de\- ployed at an extraordinary scale\. In August 2021 the IMF issued $650 billion equivalent in new Spe\- cial Drawing Rights, the largest in the fund’s history

— even if the process took much longer than what would have been feasible\. The new Special Drawing Rights provided vital support for national economies as governments battled the health and economic damage the pandemic wrought\. A G20\-sponsored Debt Service Suspension Initiative granted 73 coun\- tries temporary relief on debt\-service payments until December 2021\. Government fiscal responses were

among the largest in recent history, totalling $16 tril\- lion in support between April 2020 and April 2021\.91 These resources were poured into helping house\- holds and businesses survive the crisis through a variety of instruments, including direct transfers, ex\- panded benefits, payment deferrals and liquidity in\- jections\. To deliver these massive financial support measures, governments moved to rapidly upgrade existing social protection systems and develop new facilities, such as for digital payments\.

The response to the Covid\-19 pandemic has reminded us how people\-centric policies can substantially enhance human wellbeing

“

The response to the Covid\-19 pandemic has also reminded us how people\-centric policies can sub\- stantially enhance human wellbeing\. As the pandem\- ic’s economic, social and health impacts mounted, governments around the world deployed a flurry of expansive social protection measures to support people through the crisis\. More than 1,600 social protection measures were reported across virtual\- ly all countries and territories in February 2020 and January 2021\.92 The scope and scale of these meas\- ures were unprecedented in many settings\. In sever\- al countries governments expanded protections for losses of livelihoods and income \(see monetary sup\- port measures in figure 5\.6\)\. Many began to extend direct transfers, in the form of cash payments and guaranteed income\. Where transfer programmes al\- ready existed, governments increased benefits and expanded coverage to include more recipients\.93 By the end of 2020, cash transfers had reached nearly

- 
	1. billion people worldwide, with coverage growing by 240 percent on average relative to prepandemic levels\.94 By some estimates almost 17 percent of the world’s people saw at least one Covid\-19\-related cash transfer payment between 2020 and 2021\.95 Several countries delivered one\-off payments to their pop\- ulations on a universal or near\-universal basis\.96 In addition to cushioning the blow of lost livelihoods, income support programmes helped stem the spread of Covid\-19\. In low\-income countries income sup\- port measures were found effective in reducing the growth rate of Covid\-19 cases, and in middle\-income countries they helped reduce both case growth rates and deaths linked to Covid\-19\.97

Many social protection schemes saw unprecedent\- ed expansions in scope, reaching groups that have been excluded from support in the past, such as in\- formal sector workers and the self\-employed\.98 Gov\- ernments of several countries provided food aid, delivering baskets of staples and essential foods to households for free\.99 Some suspended routine pay\- ments and contributions, including for utility bills, loans and pension schemes\. Mobile payment systems were deployed to deliver financial support—in Bang\- ladesh, Jordan and Mali for instance—to minimize the need to visit banks and service providers in per\- son\. Countries turned to online application systems to reach as many of their citizens as they could\. Brazil expanded coverage for households already registered as potential beneficiaries and then registered about 27 million households within a few weeks through an online system\.100

Since Covid\-19 triggered a public health crisis, measures to expand health coverage were deployed around the world \(see health measures in figure 5\.6\)\. Several countries sought to ensure that facilities to identify, diagnose and treat Covid\-19 were readily available at low or no cost\. Many countries sought to

close gaps in health coverage by expanding existing schemes to cover additional segments of their pop\- ulations, such as temporary and migrant workers\. Paid sick leave and other forms of support were ex\- panded, such as compensation for earnings lost due to self\-isolation and quarantine\.101

These efforts reflected the urgency of the crisis, and emergency measures are unlikely to remain in place indefinitely, as figure 5\.6 seems to confirm\. But they have demonstrated that inequalities and gaps in social protection are not insurmountable\. They have shown that governments can do more to make social protection a reality\. And they have shown that interventions in income security and healthcare in particular can make an enormous difference to peo\- ple’s lives\. The Covid\-19 pandemic may have helped broaden public appreciation for social protection and improve government experience with delivering it\. And it has added to a growing evidence base on the effectiveness of relatively untested social protection measures, such as guaranteed basic incomes\.

The Covid\-19 pandemic has also brought previous\- ly neglected concerns to the forefront of the reform agenda\. Bridging digital disparities has become more

<a id="_bookmark105"></a>urgent than ever, as the pandemic made affordable internet access essential for education as schools closed \(recognizing, though, that it should not be seen as a replacement for in\-person education\)\. Gov\- ernments around the world ramped up e\-government facilities to continue delivering essential government services, manage new demands \(including adminis\- tering expanded social protection programmes\) and provide dedicated Covid\-19 information portals\.102 Living with Covid\-19 is providing new impetus to digitalization efforts, bolstered by a renewed aware\- ness that going online can create new possibilities for public administration and that strengthening internet access and infrastructure could be essential for resil\- ience against future disasters\.103

Tools such as nowcasting \(providing real\-time in\- formation about economic and social processes as they unfold, as opposed to waiting for official statis\- tical information\) are already gaining traction in ef\- forts to understand and respond to the fast\-moving crisis presented by Covid\-19\. Alternative data sources such as mobility data, congestion data, mobile pay\- ment patterns and internet search activity are being incorporated into models for understanding outbreak patterns and economic activity\.104

This spate of policy activism, through ramped up social protection and new delivery mechanisms, may have reset public expectations of what governments are able to do, at least for some people\. If sustained, a new mindset about what governments can do for people opens new possibilities to transform econom\- ic policy thinking and approaches as we confront the challenges ahead\.

New reference points for altering norms and behaviour

Covid\-19 showed us that people all over the world are willing to dramatically alter their everyday conduct in service of a common purpose\. Although responses to the Covid\-19 pandemic became the focus of divisions in society sometimes associated with political polari\- zation, as discussed in chapter 3, there was remarka\- ble and unprecedented behavioural and institutional change\. Combating the spread of Covid\-19 required a range of social and behavioural changes such as so\- cial distancing, contact tracing, masking and restric\- tions on gatherings\. These changes could not have

been sustained without voluntary cooperation from the vast majority of the world’s population\. A sur\- vey of people in 58 countries during the early stages of the pandemic showed high voluntary compliance with several behavioural measures: 91 percent of re\- spondents reported that they did not attend any so\- cial gatherings, 78 percent said that they stayed home in the week before the survey and 93 percent said that they would have informed people around them if they experienced Covid\-19 symptoms\.105 A different study of pandemic\-related behaviour in 28 countries in August 2020 found that 58 percent of respondents reported always or frequently avoiding having guests in their homes and that 78 percent reported always or frequently avoiding crowds\.106

Covid\-19 showed us that people all over the world are willing to dramatically alter their everyday conduct in service of a common purpose

“

Behaviours that were exceedingly rare in many societies becoming commonplace, such as wearing masks, suggests the emergence of new social norms\. This means that people are motivated not only by the need to protect themselves but also by a sense of shared responsibility, a perception that others are doing the same or the possibility of social disapprov\- al for noncompliance\. People in several countries reported feeling proud of their contribution to stop\- ping the spread of Covid\-19 and believing that they were setting a good example by wearing a mask\.107 A variety of interventions based on new social norms engendered by Covid\-19 can be considered for fu\- ture disease control, including normalizing paid sick leave, voluntary social distancing and self\-isolation in the event of exposure to infection\.108

\*	\*	\*

The foreseeable future remains one of uncertainty\. Social upheaval, climate and environmental crises and rapidly changing technology may be here to stay for some time\. The Covid\-19 pandemic has given us a glimpse of the kinds of reality we may need to con\- front\. It has also shown us who we are in times of cri\- ses, how we can mobilize with a sense of common purpose and how we may yet shape our common des\- tiny\. The extent to which we succeed in this era of un\- certainty is up to us\.

Our ability to manage this new reality will be strengthened only with a new resolve for far\-reaching change\. The pandemic has disrupted the world, and it is unlikely, even undesirable, that things will return to how they once were\. And there is much more left to do\. Our response to the crisis has shown us some of the possibilities for ensuring that the world will be more just and resilient\. We have seen that it is possible to substantially reorient people’s relationships with gov\- ernments and that this reorientation can deliver enor\- mous improvements to people’s lives\. The pandemic showed that social protection can work better where it corresponds to how people actually live, work and

navigate times of crisis\. We saw how people possess an immeasurable capacity to care for one another—and how our ties to one another provide an invisible infra\- structure for human flourishing\. We saw also that our ability to spur technological innovation can dramati\- cally expand our possibilities for surviving and thriv\- ing\. More than any single technology or invention, it is our capacity for innovation at large that matters the most\. Technological advances will be vital for the structural changes needed in our economies and soci\- ety\. The direction of technological change remains up to us, and much can be achieved by turning its poten\- tial to tackle the challenges we face\.

PART II — SHAPING OUR FUTURE IN A TRANSFORMING WORLD 

<a id="_bookmark106"></a>__CHAPTER 6__

Charting paths to transformation:

Navigating uncertainty to expand human development

The hero and the villain in today’s uncertainty story is one and the same: human choices\.

So, what practical choices can be made for the better?

This chapter emphasizes policies that focus on the Three I’s: investment, insurance and innovation\.

Together, these will promote, protect and stimulate human development for people and planet to flourish in the face of new uncertainties\.

Culture plays a big role, too\. The chapter identifies three enablers of cultural change: education to

cultivate evolving values, social recognition to legitimize them and representation to protect their inclusiveness and translate them into policies\.

176	HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2021/2022 

<a id="_bookmark107"></a>Enhancing human development—by expanding free\- doms and achievements in wellbeing and agency—is an open\-ended process filled with new possibilities\. Uncertainty is part of that journey, and as human in\- genuity pushes forward the frontier of the possible, new unintended consequences are bound to arise, good and bad\. And new challenges can mean room for new opportunities\. To thrive under uncertainty, as important as averting the negative consequences of well\-intended actions, is to grab the opportunities that emerge\.

Today we seem to be living through several un\- intended consequences of progress, as reflected in part in the three layers of uncertainty—the danger\- ous planetary changes in the Anthropocene, the un\- predictability in uncharted transitions, and the social division and polarization of societies\. Our choices and the values that underpin them have at times pro\- moted socially, economically and environmentally unsustainable policies and development paths\. Ine\- qualities have allowed a few to benefit while many get left behind\.

Our choices and the values that underpin them have at times promoted socially, economically and environmentally unsustainable policies and development paths

“

The image of the “empty box” in chapter 1, with no country so far achieving a very high Human De\- velopment Index \(HDI\) value with low pressures on the planet, suggests that our societies need to devise new ways of pursuing development\. Chasing higher GDP per capita or even higher HDI values alone is not enough\.

The call is thus for transformational change, which requires enhancing social arrangements to address people’s insecurity and unsettledness\. But this pro\- vides only a partial response\. We are not confront\- ing a small adjustment or transitory imbalance\. We are navigating uncharted territory, where social and planetary systems are adjusting simultaneously\. The assumption in much economic analysis that all other conditions remain unchanged does not hold\.

Transformational change may be needed be\- yond policies and institutional arrangements\. Soci\- eties also might need to shift social norms, beliefs and values \(introduced in chapter 3 as culture\)\. The

Dasgupta Review on the economics of biodiversity argues for ensuring that societies’ demands on nature do not exceed nature’s sustainable supply, for adopt\- ing different metrics of economic success and for transforming our institutions and systems—particu\- larly those in finance and education—to enable these changes and sustain them for future generations\.1 But the review goes further, coming to a startling conclu\- sion: “No social mechanism can meet this problem in its entirety, meaning that no institution can be de\- vised to enforce socially responsible conduct\.”2

The problem is that humans are embedded in na\- ture, so current and future wellbeing depends on maintaining the integrity of the biosphere, yet peo\- ple’s conduct is undermining that very integrity\. As if this were not challenging enough, the Dasgupta Review argues that “unlike the economics of cli\- mate change, \[…\] the economics of biodiversity \[…\] requires not only national and intergovernmental en\- gagement, but engagement by communities and civil societies throughout the world\.”3 How, then, can such a problem be solved? If these conclusions are star\- tling, the recommendation on what to do may seem even more so: “It would seem then that, ultimately, we each have to serve as judge and jury for our own actions\. And that cannot happen unless we develop an affection for Nature and its processes\.”4

Social mechanisms to address collective problems usually rely on appealing to people’s interests \(such as price incentives to tax pollution\) or creating in\- stitutions \(property rights over land or a specific re\- source, such as a forest\)\. Interests and institutions clearly matter, but the headline recommendation of the Dasgupta Review can be interpreted to take us to the world of ideas—or of culture \(chapter 3\)\.

And why invoke the relevance of ideas, of culture, now? Many communities in history have had a deep affection for nature\. Chief Elesi of Odogbolu living in Nigeria stated in 1917: “I conceive that land belongs to a vast family of which many are dead, few are liv\- ing and countless others unborn\.”5 The 2020 Human Development Report documented how indigenous peoples over time have held—and today in many communities around the world continue to hold—be\- liefs and values that reflect “an affection for Nature and its processes\.”6 Many are persecuted and killed when their actions based on such beliefs come into conflict with interests shaped by existing institutions,

<a id="_bookmark108"></a>from mining to expanding agriculture\.7 But now the challenges that we confront go beyond climate change and preserving the integrity of biodiversity functions: these are but two of the manifestations of our Anthropocene context\.

In addition to dangerous planetary change, the other layers of uncertainty documented in this Re\- port are unsettling people’s lives\. The conflicts that play out at the local level between indigenous peoples and firms or authorities are a microcosm of a broader set of tensions that may not be resolved by arbitrating between competing interests\. It seems reasonable to suggest, in addition to re\-examining policies and in\- stitutions \(which is typically the remit of work such as the Human Development Report\), that the cultural context—the ideas, broadly defined to include prac\- tices, beliefs, norms, values and technologies—also bears re\-examining to explore a way forward as we navigate today’s uncertain world\.

Examining culture opens new vistas for the range of possible actions by those in positions of power and the potential for new social mechanisms to address the unprecedented challenges we are confronting today\. But that requires two things\. First is broadening our perspective on the determinants of people’s choices\. And second is reflecting on more recent perspectives about what culture is, how it changes across contexts and over time and how it is used by people in strategic ways, rather than as a fixed latent variable working si\- lently in the background\. Key for both is recognizing the importance of agency and freedom, the tenets of the human development approach \(chapter 3\)\.

A framework to embrace uncertainty

Navigating the uncertainty complex demands dou\- bling down on human development to ensure that people have the capabilities to harness the poten\- tial embedded in uncertain times\. “The cunning of uncertainty opens new spaces and facilitates the emergence of alternative options\. Ambiguities per\- mit boundary crossings where closure between knowledge domains or areas of strictly defined ex\- pertise have reigned\. Ambiguities do not mean that everything becomes fuzzy and porous or that any\- thing goes\. They mean acknowledging that social life is full of contradictions and that social beings have the ability to navigate between them\. Once they have

the necessary resources, they also negotiate with each other viable options for living together\.”8

Navigating the uncertainty complex demands doubling down on human development to ensure that people have the capabilities to harness

“

the potential embedded in uncertain times

We propose a two\-tier framework to respond to a dual gap in our uncertain times\. On the one hand, a mismatch between current social arrangements struggling to promote human security and to tack\- le people’s unsettledness\. On the other hand, a mis\- match between prevalent beliefs and values and what might be needed to navigate through the uncertainty complex \(figure 6\.1\)\.

The first tier is about what to do, with a focus on concrete transformations on three fronts: invest\- ment, insurance and innovation\.

- Investment, in the capabilities people will need to enable socioeconomic and planetary conditions for human flourishing\.
- Insurance, to protect people from the unavoidable contingencies of uncertain times, safeguarding their capabilities, including their fundamental freedoms \(enhancing human security\)\.
- Innovation, to foster capabilities that might not exist today\.

The second tier is about how to generate the broad\- er social and contextual conditions for change to take hold, acknowledging the role of culture as described in chapter 3\.

- Education, to strengthen agency and encourage people to shape their own future\.
- Recognition, to acknowledge human rights and respect for people’s identities and values to change scripts and narratives that build hope in society\.
- Representation, to amplify the power and voice that strengthen representation and agency\.

Insights from cultural change suggest cultivating motivating principles that can both enhance social ar\- rangements and shape cultural evolution in uncertain times\.9 The motivating principles highlighted in this Report are flexibility, creativity, solidarity and inclu\- sion \(spotlight 6\.1\)\.

No single set of policy recommendations can suit every context and every country, but using these princi\- ples as a compass can help navigate through the layers

of uncertainty and inspire people to embrace uncer\- tainty\. Flexibility, creativity, solidarity and inclusion build pathways to transformation by strengthening re\- silience10 and agency,11 as they increase communities’ capacity to thrive in environments characterized by change\. For instance, in the context of societal respons\- es to Covid\-19 in the G7 countries, differences in soli\- darity and agency were much more marked than in the economic and environmental policies pursued, point\- ing to the importance of supplementing economic poli\- cies with solidarity\- and agency\-enhancing actions\.12

Investment, insurance and innovation towards continually expanding human development

Thriving under uncertainty is possible\. Three policy building blocks that would shape transformations to

expand human development could provide support in facing the layers of uncertainty from dangerous planetary change, uncharted transitions and polari\- zation\. The first is investment, encompassing people and financial and natural resources\. The second is insurance mechanisms that guarantee protection or compensation in the case of shocks or threats ema\- nating from planetary imbalances or insecurities and that can bring a greater sense of control\. The third is innovation, to embrace change, looking for new solutions through creativity, iterative learning and diverse perspectives\. Investment, insurance and in\- novation all safeguard and promote agency, thus ad\- vancing human development\. Implementing these mechanisms aims to grow opportunities for the fu\- ture while advancing human potential in the present\.13 Figure 6\.2 identifies some of the policy examples ex\- plored below\.

Investment—in capabilities to thrive under uncertainty

The first building block encompasses investment in the capabilities required to successfully navigate an uncertain future\. It includes policies focused on en\- hancing capabilities as well as on forming the assets to do so—meaning different forms of capital, includ\- ing natural capital\.

The context of multilayered uncertainties sets up new challenges but also new possibilities for the long\-standing aspiration to provide global public goods\.14 On the challenges the three layers of un\- certainty render investments in global public goods more difficult: the planetary scale of the Anthropo\- cene’s challenges generates a mismatch with the geographic scope of national governments,15 while political polarization and transition uncertainty com\- plicate how domestic priorities are weighed against international challenges\. This was made starkly clear during the Covid\-19 pandemic, as the world strug\- gled and failed to ensure universal access to personal protective equipment and then vaccines, despite hav\- ing the scientific, technological and financial capaci\- ties to make the investments needed to do so\.16

But the uncertainty complex also makes the case for investing in providing global public goods more compelling\. The additional investment to avoid fu\- ture pandemics is estimated to be $15 billion a year\.17

This is a tiny fraction of the economic cost of the Covid\-19 pandemic \(without considering any human cost in lives lost or learning lost\): more than $7 tril\- lion in lost production and more than $16\.9 trillion in emergency fiscal responses\.18 The investment is also very small compared with the $650 billion dollar is\- suance of special drawing rights\.19 The rational case for investing in global public goods has been made many times, as has the need to craft appropriate ar\- rangements that sustain international coordination or cooperation\.20

But with the recognition of the uncertainty com\- plex lies the opportunity to look across the interac\- tions of the layers of uncertainty and not only work through formal existing structures and rules but also encourage experimentation and innovation\.21 This can be advanced by recognizing that providing global public goods in a context of novel uncertainty can be enhanced with institutions of multilevel governance offering compelling narratives that foster coopera\- tion and coordination through the legitimacy of en\- visioning better futures\.22 These institutions would embrace uncertainty, which means adopting policies and strategies robust to many alternative futures\. Normative goals—if formulated with participation, flexibility to iterate and informed rigorous research— could help produce assessments that offer more ro\- bust policy options beyond just alerting the world of the extreme possibilities to come\.23 They could be

<a id="_bookmark111"></a>even more robust if these assessments took a holis\- tic view, focusing on the behaviour of the individual components and agents in socioecological systems as well as their interactions and relationships\.24

Investment is also essential in complex governance systems \(governmental and beyond\) that can exper\- iment, respond quickly, draw on all relevant knowl\- edge and account for heterogeneity of societies, while overcoming the power imbalances that entrench

vested interests\. This would promote inclusion and build trust for sustained collective action and solidari\- ty \(box 6\.1\)\. Investing in governance also means craft\- ing systems that can redress inequality and provide individual and group recognition to enable dignity by, among other things, strengthening social policies and fostering civic \(re\)engagement and participation\.25

Investment is also needed in nature\-based human development, including bottom\-up efforts that rely

__Box 6\.1 Governance for systemic and transformational change__

The Anthropocene represents a complex set of crises of a kind humanity has not previously confronted\. Human impact on the planet and unsustainable economic and social systems virtually guarantee environmental and societal upheaval for the foreseeable future\. Every polity will experience the effects for generations to come\.

Complexity theory helps us understand what it takes to manage such systemic problems: holistic analysis, constant experimentation and the inclusion of many disciplines and perspectives\. But our existing governance processes are designed largely to sort people and issues into siloed boxes onto which “optimal” procedures can be applied, sandpapering away the diversity and volatility that characterize reality\.

It is entirely possible to govern for the complex systemic problems we confront\.1 Such governance must focus not just on the behaviour of individual components and actors in interrelated systems but also on their interactions and relationships\.2 It must adopt policies and strategies that are robust to alternative futures and adaptable in the face of rapid change\. Specifically, it must aim to \(re\)build social capital at scale, build meaningful networks across decision silos and create effective, inclusive layers of governance that keep decisionmaking as close to local knowledge as possible\. To those ends governance should be based on four principles: systemic thinking, transparency, social inclusion and subsidiarity\.

The most important change that Anthropocene governance requires is the shift to systemic thinking and decision\- making\. Some of the actions decisionmakers can take are mapping the system using social or organizational network analysis;3 employing tools such as scenario\-based planning for a variety of alternative outcomes and conditions;4 and continuously monitoring, evaluating and assessing the impact of policies\.

Transparency in governance refers to the degree to which information is available to all stakeholders and enables them to have an informed voice in decisions and assess the choices made by insiders\.5 It is essential both for ac\- countability and for making governance effective and responsive, as meaningful transparency permits feedback on how well policies and experiments are working and what adaptations may be needed\.

Inclusion in governance refers to expanding meaningful participation to a wide array of stakeholders and ensuring they have both deliberative and decisionmaking powers\. Governance must prioritize inclusivity for three reasons: it is necessary for reducing power imbalances, networks with a diverse and distributed structure are more resilient to shocks and disruptions, and greater inclusion fosters legitimacy\.

Subsidiarity made possible by adequate transparency and inclusion then becomes a key principle for creating re\- silience in a multilayered governance structure\. It refers to how “social and political issues should be dealt with at the most immediate level consistent with their adequate resolution\.”6 If practised well, governance based on subsidiarity can bolster the efficacy and legitimacy of policy responses because local authorities tend to be physically closer, more connected and more visible to the people they serve\.

Governance based on these principles gives humanity its best shot at effectively and justly transforming the exist\- ing systems for creating, using and disposing of the material substrate of human society\. Such governance has the potential to shift us towards greater adaptability, to strengthen the societal trust that is key to effective governance in challenging times and to improve prospects for sustainable development in the Anthropocene\.

<a id="_bookmark112"></a>on the inclusion, participation and knowledge of local communities and indigenous peoples,26 leveraging their potential to both learn and scale up transform\- ative change\.27 Examples include investing in green areas to manage the risk of extreme temperatures, reducing ecosystem\-based disaster risk, improving water quality, ensuring water availability and improv\- ing agricultural practices to ensure food security\. The value of these efforts often goes beyond the contribu\- tions to communities\. So, instead of treating them as isolated initiatives, countries should integrate them into national development priorities across domains, including water security, food security, disaster risk reduction and economic performance\. Nature\-based human development both relies on and can enhance the agency of local communities and indigenous peo\- ples; it also provides for diverse visions of what is a good life, incorporates justice and inclusion in con\- servation and promotes education and knowledge sharing\.28

Insurance—against the interacting layers of uncertainty

Insurance guarantees protection or compensation against shocks emanating from the interacting layers of uncertainty\. A key goal is to enhance human se\- curity\. As chapter 4 describes, human insecurity not only constrains agency and fundamental freedoms but also hinders collective action\. People have always confronted adverse outcomes—illness, death or in\- juries that preclude someone from providing for the household—and extended families, friends and local communities have often been a source of support\.

Charities or religious institutions have some\- times helped\. Groups engaged in dangerous occu\- pations such as mining established mutual societies

for an injured or incapacitated member of the group to receive support from the others, and some mar\- ket insurance eventually developed out of these arrangements\.

It is critical to expand market insurance, under properly regulated frameworks that protect users and address several of the well\-known market failures in insurance markets \(including moral hazard and ad\- verse selection\)\. Equally important, market insur\- ance providers will face the challenge of innovating to offer services that address the novel context of un\- certainty, for which existing actuarial practices may not be fully adequate\.

It is also crucial to expand, and innovate in, social insurance\. Over the 20th century government\-fund\- ed social insurance programmes expanded around the world\. Public social welfare spending in Organi\- sation for Economic Co\-operation and Development \(OECD\) countries grew from a median of 0\.4 percent of GDP in 1900 to 18\.6 percent in 2017\. Private \(man\- datory and voluntary\) social welfare spending has also increased in recent decades, from a median of 1\.1 per\- cent of GDP in OECD countries in 1980 to 2\.1 percent in 2017—reaching more than 10 percent in the Neth\- erlands, Switzerland and the United States\.30

There is great diversity across countries in the level and categories of spending, in the mix of taxation to fund government programmes and in the reliance on private provision\. But the bulk of the increase in OECD countries is related to contributory social in\- surance programmes to support older people and to pay for healthcare expenses, with both workers and employees contributing to fund government pro\- grammes\. Denmark and New Zealand rely, instead, on general tax revenues only\. Most striking, howev\- er, is how much less spending there is in non\-OECD countries: total social protection spending increased from a median of 4\.5 percent of GDP in 2000 to only

6\.3 percent in 2015 in 46 countries that account for most of the world’s population\. In several African countries less than 3 percent of the population living in the bottom 40 percent of the income distribution is expected to rely on support from governments or nongovernmental organizations—and the rest were most likely to rely on family and friends \(box 6\.2\)\.31

Macroprudential measures can be implemented to promote financial stability, in part learning from the lessons of the global financial crisis\. Most central

<a id="_bookmark113"></a>__Box 6\.2 The heightened importance of expanding and innovating in social protection__

Expanding and improving social insurance, recognized as important for a while, acquire heightened relevance in today’s uncertain times\. Social insurance enhances human security and can stimulate risk taking and investment, supporting other elements of institutional change and policies\. The reverse also holds: some investments can provide insurance\. For instance, investments in nature\-based human development can be an effective tool for achieving resilience to shocks\.1

Key policies in this area relate to social protection2 that can shield people against shocks, achieving a dual purpose: protection and promotion\.3 The need to balance both raises questions about the appropriate mix of targeted and universal policies\. The interaction of inequalities, hierarchical power imbalances, polarization and conflicts can com\- plicate reaching consensus for social policies\.4 Social protection income and providing public goods can reduce in\- equality while preventing political polarization, potentially reversing entrenched polarized attitudes\.5 So it is important to deliver mechanisms that reach everyone, independent of economic status\. For instance, a social protection model that was born to tackle social protection simultaneously with climate adaptation and disaster risks is adaptative social protection\.6 Adaptative social protection builds safety nets \(savings, insurance, information\) to prepare households to act on unforeseen situations, so they can smooth consumption, retain assets and reduce exposure to shocks\.7

banks have stability objectives, and they apply dif\- ferent tools that work as insurance instruments to build resilience\.32 The most common mechanisms are countercyclical capital buffers and capital require\- ments, which serve as a shock absorber, sector\-spe\- cific capital requirements for the banking sector, and loan\-to\-income or loan\-to\-value ratios that increase bank capital above the minimum\.33 Although in most countries these instruments are under the Central Bank’s control, in some \(such as Brazil and South Af\- rica\) decisionmaking responsibility is shared\. Not all countries have the same mechanisms available—for example, Argentina, Brazil, Chile, China, Colombia, Peru and Türkiye use other prudential instruments such as reserve or cash requirements on domestic de\- posits\. Reducing the costs of future systemic shocks and containing vulnerabilities require building mac\- roeconomic prudency and coordinating with mone\- tary policy\.34

Approaches such as state\-contingent debt instru\- ments can help economies respond to shocks quickly and predictably\. These instruments enable countries to manage their sovereign debt payments depending on changes in their capacity to pay as a direct result of shocks\.35 Mexico, Nigeria and Venezuela have linked these instruments to commodity prices \(such as oil

prices\); Argentina, Greece and Ukraine have linked them to GDP variations; and Barbados and Grenada have linked them to the effects of natural hazards\. State\-contingent debt instruments act as insurance that gives countries the space to apply countercyclical and stabilization policies that are immediately trig\- gered after well\-specified adverse events take place\. After the event, and by contract, either the maturity or the volume of payments to creditors \(or both\) is ad\- justed to give more fiscal space to the sovereign debt\- or\. Creditors can count on a predictable response as specified in the contract, as opposed to being subject to ad hoc and unpredictable processes of potential debt restructuring\.36

Access to financial services can greatly contribute to people’s abilities to navigate changing and uncer\- tain economic conditions\. Financial inclusion can re\- duce poverty and inequality through access to credit and insurance\.37 Moreover, digital banking and pay\- ment, loan and credit services enable wider finan\- cial inclusion, especially among underserved groups and in low\- and middle\-income countries\.38 Financial literacy is an important accompaniment to greater financial inclusion because it develops tools, knowl\- edge, confidence and awareness related to person\- al and business finances\. Important state\-led and

<a id="_bookmark114"></a>private initiatives exist to strengthen these capabili\- ties—for example, by incorporating financial literacy content in education curricula\.39

One of the main challenges policymakers face is in\- adequate coverage of the people most likely to be left behind\. Targeted social policies that are based on in\- come can easily exclude informal workers\. Such pol\- icies might have requirements that leave individuals at higher risk of slipping through the cracks\.40 With these challenges combining with other recent threats, such as the Covid\-19 pandemic, the focus of the de\- bate has shifted more to universalism\. An example to take advantage of the structures that have already been built is the implementation of systems that ben\- efit all, such as universal access to health, education, care or income\.41

A minimum guaranteed income has been tested through pilot projects in India, Kenya and Namibia\.42 One of the main operational challenges for these pro\- grammes is that they are financed by taxation, and countries with lower incomes have limited formal tax systems and income data\.43 Another concern is that a minimum guaranteed income does not provide an integrated solution across other human development dimensions, so it could divert resources from other government\-subsidized or universal services, such as education, and distort economic incentives\. Howev\- er, a universal basic income needs to be seen not only in the context of the world today—in which limited government resources and acute needs may tilt the argument towards targeted transfers—but also as pre\- paring for the world of tomorrow, when the nature of future work may change\.44

Many have advocated shifting the debate towards universal basic services, to guarantee that everyone meets their basic needs and has expanded opportu\- nities and participation independent from contin\- gencies\.45 Universal access to services can still lead to inequalities in human development\. And as the recent Special Report on Human Security points out, universalism must consider equity and quality and not just cover essential needs\.46 In some countries health and education are already built on universal basic service principles, but this can be expanded to housing, care, transportation, information, securi\- ty and nutrition\.47 Universal access to mental health services48 enables people to deal with mental distress and thrive, and these services could be offered within

existing social structures, such as schools and com\- munity centres\.

Good practices in promoting human rights point towards identifying what binds us together and engaging people in dialogue about human rights in their daily lives

“

Universal basic services are also based on solidar\- ity, as it recognizes that needs and the responsibili\- ty to fulfil them are shared in the collective\. A study of 19 countries in Latin America and the Caribbean determined that policies across the region explicitly mention that no child or adolescent should be left out of the education system and designed method\- ologies based on the Universal Design for Learn\- ing\.49 In El Salvador’s Modelo Escuela Inclusiva de Tiempo Pleno, flexible pedagogic programmes were adapted for different students based on inclusion principles\.50 The study also highlights that the chal\- lenge for inclusive education is achieving not just a technical change but also a social change\. When ap\- proaching universal policies in practice, it is impor\- tant to consider all actors \(teachers, administrators, parents\), create local support networks and trans\- form the institutional culture with a shift in attitudes and norms\.51

Protecting human rights can work as insurance by shielding people in times of uncertainty \(box 6\.3\)\. Mechanisms that rebuild trust and promote under\- standing,52 respect, inclusion and equality can help in navigating conflicts and impacts of displacement\. In some cases policy design and programme selec\- tion that consider human and environmental rights can be helpful in a context of contested and uncertain futures\.53 Examples include strategic impact assess\- ments, regulatory impact assessments and cost\-ben\- efit analyses that consider both international and local regulations, such as access to water and full citi\- zenship and recognition of people who identify as les\- bian, gay, bisexual, transgender, intersex or another sexual minority \(LGBTQI\+\)\.54

Good practices in promoting human rights point towards identifying what binds us together and en\- gaging people in dialogue about human rights in their daily lives\.55 Practices such as volunteerism and policy mechanisms that favor inclusion and that en\- hance deliberative processes can also be interpreted

<a id="_bookmark115"></a>__Box 6\.3 Navigating uncertainty—the human rights anchor__

In a context of uncertainty, it is extremely difficult \(maybe impossible\) to think of ideal scenarios or optimal policies\. Even more so in a context of a plurality of views, where decisions are heavily affected by cultural context and emo\- tions \(chapter 3\)\.1 Amartya Sen advocated that it is possible to make progress in assessing policy objectives without necessarily searching for the conditions of an ideal world\. The key is to identify “clearly remediable injustices\.”2 Not an easy task, either\. But humanity has made remarkable progress in defining some normative principles that should remain valid in the new context\. Probably the most important consensus is encoded in the internationally agreed 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights\.

Human rights and human development are linked\.3 Their concepts have a common motivation, and several human rights can be seen as rights to capabilities\. However, capabilities tend to refer to the opportunity to choose among different alternatives for what one would like to do \(opportunity freedoms\), while human rights also encompass the chance to choose freely \(process freedoms\)\.4

In times of change and deep uncertainty, human rights become even more salient to guide our collective actions for three main reasons\.

First, in a context of deep social and planetary transformations, is that they retain the focus on people\.

Second is their emphasis on fundamental freedoms, which depend not only on achievements but also on the agency of people \(a dimension that has often been missing in public discussions; see chapter 3\)\. In this space hu\- man security is a subset of these fundamental freedoms \(freedom from fear, from want and from indignity\), explicitly mentioned in the preamble of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights\.

Third is their universality\. This defines a space of equality across all people on the planet\. The 2019 Human Devel\- opment Report highlights that this condition \(inherited by the description of several Sustainable Development Goals\) allows the analysis of inequalities to be refocused beyond income, including on the gaps in agency and freedoms\.5 The 2020 Human Development Report underscores that the lack of recognition of human rights amid dangerous planetary change can perpetuate discrimination and injustice and makes navigation harder in the Anthropocene context\.6

The universality of human rights also ensures their validity in the expanding digital world\. This is critical for protect\- ing the right to participate in the cultural life of communities, the right to freedom of expression while addressing online hate speech and disinformation, and the right to privacy\.7

Innovation—expanding societies’ chances to thrive in uncertainty

Innovation refers to mechanisms that look for new approaches through creativity and iterative learn\- ing drawing from diverse perspectives\. As chapter 5 mentions, technological innovation can expand societies’ chances for thriving in uncertainty\. It is important to prioritize investments in research and science to push the frontiers of knowledge and mo\- bilize technological change to complement, and not replace, people\. As chapter 1 highlights, it is also fundamental to innovate responsibly, addressing

justice and sustainability seeking to avoid power concentration\.

Peacebuilding is one space where innovative ap\- proaches are being applied to manage complexity\. Born out of new understanding of complexity and resilience, adaptive peacebuilding prioritizes itera\- tive learning to sustain peace, where peace is seen as a continuous process rather than an end\.56 Draw\- ing on insights from complexity theory, the approach recognizes that peacebuilding must respond to con\- tinuously changing circumstances\. The objectives for peacebuilders then become working with communi\- ties and people affected by conflict, facilitating the creation of self\-organized and resilient social institu\- tions that can embrace uncertainties and channelling nonviolent responses to stressors and shocks\.57 This is achieved through participatory decisionmaking,

<a id="_bookmark116"></a>constant iteration and variety of solutions\.58 Lessons from church\-based groups, local nongovernmental organizations and government initiatives for adaptive peacebuilding in Rwanda point to focusing on local needs for transitional justice\. Religious institutions facilitated spaces for Hutu, Tutsi and Twa to come together and process their grief and honour their loved ones after the genocide\. Civil society leaders encouraged Rwandans to take advantage of their cul\- tural repertoires for healing\. Through *kwihangana,*59 communities achieved conflict resolution through patience and gift giving\. Local nongovernmental or\- ganizations focused on tackling socioeconomic con\- ditions and the mental health of women who had faced sexual violence\. The government implemented efforts to resonate with local adaptive peacebuilding strategies,60 teaching reconciliation in schools and providing a space for commemoration and public memory\.

Because shocks, crises and conflicts can have seri\- ous effects on mental wellbeing, they should ideally be prevented\. This is not always possible, but meas\- ures can be implemented to mitigate crises, and in\- novations can help improve mental wellbeing—for example, mechanisms that connect mental wellbeing to peacebuilding or psychological resilience building techniques\.61 \(See spotlight 6\.4 for an elaboration of the framework “Preventing distress, mitigating cri\- ses and building resilience” introduced in figure 2\.9 in chapter 2\)\.

Even well\-intended policies can overlook conditions that affect the groups most likely to be left behind\. In these cases social movements and community initiatives innovate and experiment with alternative views, codes, values and practices using symbols, teach\-ins, educational workshops and awareness raising

“

Urban communities are likely to have stronger networks due to the high density and proximity of services, actors and resources,62 which set the con\- ditions for innovative initiatives\. In India it is very common that in the name of solidarity, communities mobilize to establish small\-scale decentralized com\- posting plants\. The Residents’ Initiative for a Safe Environment started in Bengaluru with 1,200 house\- holds coordinating waste separation and collection at

composting sites\. The initiative depended on engag\- ing many households without external support and on their willingness to contribute financially\.63

Innovation requires creative energy to address complex problems through community interactions\.64 Dangerous planetary change and new threats are pushing some countries to transition to clean energy systems\. In India one of the challenges of distributing energy is rural areas, so the country has introduced the National Solar Mission, with mechanisms to en\- courage community\-based off\-grid projects\.65 Two initiatives based in the provinces of Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh have attempted different solutions to bring electricity to their communities\.

Innovative organized actions can strengthen the individual and community repertoires and power, in\- fluence decisionmakers and transform traditional so\- cial norms and cultural behaviours\.

Community involvement can also ensure that pol\- icies reflect people’s priorities\. Even well\-intended policies can overlook conditions that affect the groups most likely to be left behind\. In these cases so\- cial movements and community initiatives innovate and experiment with alternative views, codes, values and practices66 using symbols, teach\-ins, educational workshops and awareness raising\.67 In Israel a wel\- fare\-to\-work programme was implemented to benefit the long\-term unemployed, requiring all adults from beneficiary households to participate full time\. But the programme did not account for the needs of those dependent on unpaid care work\. A local group of men and women in one of the areas that lack day\-care fa\- cilities started advocating for their right to participate in the labour market and to have access to care\. The group organized a participatory needs assessment to express the needs of the community\.68 This example aligns with inclusive localism, focused on empow\- ering and investing in the capabilities and agency of local communities\.69

Innovation can also result from recombination or iteration\.70 Initiatives such as Thinking and Working Politically and Problem\-Driven Iterative Adaptation have an advantage when the problem is complex, the context is novel or the solutions are contentious\.71 For instance, the organization Funda Wande was created based on the fact that 58 percent of children in South Africa were unable to read for meaning in any lan\- guage at the end of grade 4\.72 The organization aimed

<a id="_bookmark117"></a>to improve children’s reading skills\. Using the itera\- tive adaptation approach73 to deconstruct the prob\- lem, it identified four main causes: weak institutional functionality, undue union influence, weak teacher content and pedagogical skills, and wasted learning time\.

Another area that requires innovation is tackling misinformation\. Major social media platforms have enacted policies such as notices, warnings and links

to resources on misinformation

Local actors, native language speakers, teachers and other relevant stakeholders were brought in for another diagnosis, which identified teacher train\- ing and reading materials as action entry points\. In Eastern Cape and Limpopo, two of the worst per\- forming provinces, iterating and revising practices led to teaching materials being produced in local lan\- guages, thereby adapting them to each setting\. Only a cheaper set of materials in native languages would accomplish widespread readership\. The organization currently runs its programme in 30 schools in Eastern Cape, 80 schools in Limpopo and 50 schools in West\- ern Cape\.74

Another area that requires innovation is tackling misinformation\. Social media have transformed the methods, speed and scale of spreading misinforma\- tion, especially where it is organized and intention\- al \(spotlight 6\.5\)\. Major social media platforms have enacted policies such as notices, warnings and links

advocating for taxes on pollution\.76 Committed re\- searchers and scientists who let their values guide their work are a powerful force, as they can draw so\- ciety’s attention to the perils of climate change77 or other development challenges\. In this sense there is also a need to expand the research and measure\- ment of social norms \(perceptions and values\),78 as understanding them is also key to socially coordinat\- ing people\.79 Beyond data collection, research is de\- veloping models to predict social norm change and methodological tools to test the causal effect of social norms\.80

Drawing from cultural change

For investment, insurance and innovation strategies to promote agency and advance human develop\- ment, opportunities for common deliberation to ac\- company cultural change are important \(figure 6\.3\)\. Building a solid institutional capacity open to di\- versity and deliberation can be seen as insurance in uncertain times\. Under uncertainty, mismatches be\- tween current and needed institutions can emerge\.81 Strengthening intergroup contact82 can reduce hos\- tilities against other parties and provide opportuni\- ties for common deliberation that fosters cultural change\.83

Education, social recognition and representation84 are some of the ways stakeholders can encourage cul\- tural change supportive of investment, insurance and innovation\.85

to resources on misinformation\. For example, links		

to official information by the World Health Organi\- zation are suggested under posts mentioning Covid\- 19 on Facebook, Instagram, TikTok and YouTube\. And Twitter alerts users who share an article without opening the link first\. At the same time fact\-checking initiatives have been created by users of these plat\- forms, and media plurality has been strengthened through new and independent outlets that could not exist or have the means to inform in the tradition\- al media landscape, often at the local and grassroot levels\.

Innovation is also important when it comes to new ways of measuring human development \(box 6\.4\)\. Motivated scientists can fulfil a social role75—for ex\- ample, in contributing to green transitions through

Education to cultivate evolving values

Education—a powerful tool to instil reasoning and critical thinking, opening possibilities for new values and attitudes in younger generations—is key for agen\- cy\. It can encourage people to act regarding climate change and other Anthropocene pressures, providing them with ownership and agency to shape their own future and hold decisionmakers to account\.86 Govern\- ments and other organizations have explored myriad education curricula to shape the next generations’ wellbeing\. One is comprehensive sexuality educa\- tion,87 an approach that schools around the world are implementing to improve sexual reproductive health, prevent dating violence and increase understanding

__Box 6\.4 Augmenting the resolution of the Human Development Index values using satellite imagery and artificial intelligence__

Data collection to measure human development is challenging\. It is difficult to get accurate and high\-quality informa\- tion for some regions across the globe\. In this context remote technology and satellite imagery can help researchers and decisionmakers observe, explore and evaluate the status of human development1 in a timely, consistent and affordable way2 and can fill gaps in official statistics\.3

The availability of geolocalized and satellite imagery data can inform decisionmakers of where to implement policies, who to target and how to allocate resources efficiently\.4 For example, targeted policies or programmes that require monitoring Human Development Index \(HDI\) values at the local level\. The United Nations Development Pro\- gramme \(UNDP\) estimates HDI values at the national level based on country\-level data, but some countries produce subnational estimates\. There have been prior efforts to measure HDI values locally, producing a snapshot at the state or province level using survey and administrative data,5 but these remain spatially coarse and expensive to produce\. A recent collaboration between UNDP and academic researchers uses daytime and night\-time satellite imagery to estimate HDI values at highly disaggregated geographic resolution \(box figure 1\)\.6 Using a machine\-learning technique, it is possible to train an artificial intelligence algorithm that associates image elements with HDI values,

employing these image elements to estimate HDI values at the local scale\.

These results are experimental since there are no official local HDI values to fully validate these estimates\. Never\- theless, new measurement tools are promising and have great potential to be scaled up, with appropriate bench\- marking and data calibration\.7 Combining satellite imagery and machine learning is an exciting direction for future research to expand how the HDI is used for decisionmaking\.

of diverse sexual orientation and gender identities\. The curriculum has contributed to the normalization of same\-sex romantic relationships and the reduction of homophobia and homophobic bullying and har\- assment in schools\. It has also led to shifting norms around intimate partner violence, leading to the re\- duction of such cases as a result\.88

Discussions of the role of education for change in social norms envisage schools as a space that em\- bodies inclusion and diversity\. Teaching practices also affect students’ beliefs and trust in institutions\. Education not only dictates the content of students’ learning—the what—but also the how and with whom\. The how relates to teaching practices that have an impact on student beliefs and world views\. In some cases educational attainment shapes one’s be\- liefs\. Across countries women with higher education\- al attainment are less likely to believe that husbands are justified in beating their wives if they argue\.89 In addition, research sheds light on how different teach\- ing styles have divergent impacts on students’ values\. Students who are taught with horizontal teaching practices that entail working in groups on projects are more likely to participate in civic life, believe in coop\- eration with others and tolerate different ideas\.90

The question of with whom students receive educa\- tion is equally critical\. Education that provides space

for students of various backgrounds contributes to norm changes, especially tolerance for differences and diversity\.91 For example, students can understand by their lived experiences that gender does not determine one’s ability to learn or perform\. Teachers’ attitudes to\- wards female students also affect how students view equality among the sexes\. In India, when the govern\- ment of Delhi made a policy to provide at least 20 per\- cent of the seating in elite schools to students from low\-income households, students with high economic status were more understanding and had less discrim\- inatory views against the poor students\.92 Hence, regu\- lar personal interactions enabled by the inclusion and diversity policy in education destigmatized economi\- cally marginalized individuals\.

By the same token, efforts to prevent violent ex\- tremism through education aim to use education to create a space for inclusion and a sense of belonging for young people at risk of joining violent extremist groups\. Here, education serves as an alternative for such young people, as one underlying driver to join violent extremist groups appears to be feeling exclud\- ed and marginalized in the community and seeking a sense of belonging in militia groups\.93 Education also provides new knowledge and fosters critical think\- ing to strengthen students’ resilience and prevent them from subscribing to extremist ideologies when

<a id="_bookmark119"></a>exposed to them\. It can thus be a catalyst for norm change and an instrument that empowers students to shape new norms and culture\.

Recognition to enhance legitimacy

Social recognition can be accomplished through changes in laws and regulations to recognize human rights, media campaigns to raise awareness or chang\- es in policy narratives to recognize the interest of right holders and respect for their identities and val\- ues\. Take policies on recognizing same\-sex relation\- ships\. A recent study using data from the European Social Surveys evaluated the change in narratives and attitudes towards different sexual orientations in Eu\- rope after 17 countries legalized same\-sex marriage and 11 legalized same\-sex civil unions\. Individuals living in countries with legal recognition of same\-sex relationships showed more positive attitudes towards LGBT people\. These results are consistent with legit\- imacy models, where legal recognition legitimates a group in society and attitudes towards the group ad\- just as a result\.94

Social recognition can help change scripts and narratives to portray groups in different ways and build hope in society

“

Social recognition can help change scripts and nar\- ratives to portray groups in different ways and build hope in society\. Climate change activism among in\- digenous young people in New Zealand has faced multiple challenges to transforming narratives, such as anthropocentrism, racism, adultism or generic recommendations to fight planetary change\. Never\- theless, through activism and changes in education Māori youth narratives based on stories of coloni\- zation and indigenous systems of values and beliefs

health, education, land, natural resources, and labour and financial markets\. Media campaigns to prevent discrimination, reduce stigma or promote narratives that influence power balance are examples\. Con\- sider the high rates of violence against women and girls in East Africa\. A recent innovation randomly implemented a media campaign across 112 villages, reaching more than 10,000 citizens\. Results from in\- terviews several months after the experiment showed an increase in the willingness to report violence against women and girls to the authorities\.97

Media campaigns can also reduce discrimination and stigma, contribute to equal access to resources and increase freedoms and agency\. In Bangladesh a popular animated television programme, Meena, portrayed a nine\-year\-old female lead who dreamed of learning and discovered her math and writing skills through the episodes\. The programme reduced the cultural and religious stigma of girls going to school in rural areas and increased their attendance\.98 It focused on describing how religious and cultural practices can generate discrimination and affect girls’ lives and health\. By influencing beliefs around girls accessing education, the narratives could balance power and change social norms\.

More attention is needed as well to dismantle stig\- matization of mental health, which can be achieved by changing social norms and narratives\.99 In Ghana and Kenya the Time to Change Global campaign tackled stigma and discrimination against mental health, dis\- seminating on social media videos of real experiences with stigma and myths about mental health\. Accord\- ing to an evaluation, there was a significant positive impact: in Ghana the desire to socially distance from people with mental health challenges was reduced, and in Kenya knowledge of mental health increased\.100 Narratives can thus work as lenses that allow people to look at mental health from a different perspective\.

have had a ripple effect, enabling children and young		

people to feel a sense of hope and empowerment\.95 “Governance of climate and natural resources emerg\- es best when rooted in stories about human purpose, identity, duty and responsibility\.”96

Nondiscrimination mechanisms can enhance an individual’s ability to choose\. These include prevent\- ing those most likely to be left behind from being discriminated against in access to resources such as

Representation to advance inclusiveness

Finally, representation, power and voice can foster people’s ability to influence and participate while encouraging others\. Increasing the representa\- tion, power and voice of diverse experiences in public spaces, institutions, governance processes, leadership positions, art, film, photography, music

<a id="_bookmark120"></a>and writing can shape the definitions of who mat\- ters, foster their agency and encourage other people to participate\. Recent research to explore the impact of women’s representation in Cameroon’s parliament found that their presence increases their participa\-

tion in decisionmaking structures and influences the		

topics the parliament debates\.101

Considering intergenerational relationships can also point out mechanisms related to reparations, reconciliation and transitional justice\.102 Australia’s parliament issued an official acknowledgment and apology to the Stolen Generations103 and their fami\- lies and a report outlining recommendations to sup\- port reconciliation\.104 The Community Arts Network started a program to amplify the voices of indigenous elders to tell their stories of oppression, suffering and survival\. The common elements in their narratives were cycles of dispossession, consequences of dis\- possession in their lives, and cultural continuity and survival\. Through spaces of representation the in\- digenous elders gave voice to their history as part of healing, and the wider community was asked to ac\- knowledge the stories and legacy to understand the land they inhabit\.105

Participating in decisionmaking and building so\- cial networks are key to strengthen representation and agency\. Inclusion is essential for devolving de\- cisionmaking power to local contexts, through which equal participation and cooperation at the communi\- ty level can be achieved\.106 In Kutna Hora, Czechia, the government conducted participatory budgeting with young people and children in 2019\. Both prima\- ry and high school students participated in the local government’s budget allocation\. Each class appoint\- ed representatives to present a project on behalf of their schools for the budget from the school level up to the municipal level\. Young people filled the role of coordinators in the local rounds of budget allo\- cations\. In the final phase the budget allocation was opened for all the students to vote\. The initial idea from the local government was for young people to

Collective action and social movements shaping culture and coping with uncertainty

Collective action, through social movements and community\-level initiatives, can be a source of inspi\- ration for researchers, policymakers and advocates \(spotlights 6\.6 and 6\.7\)\.

To redress inequalities and provide equal oppor\- tunities for people to expand their agency and foster human development, transformation is imperative at the level of social norms and culture\. Social move\- ments are key to achieving that\.

Where we go from here is our choice

We must learn to live with uncertain times and unset\- tled lives\. This year’s Human Development Report challenges us to aspire to more than mere accommo\- dation\. Unlocking our human potential will require us to let flexibility, creativity, solidarity and inclusion guide us to imagine and create futures in which we thrive\.

Where we go from here is our choice\. One of the great lessons of our species’ history is that we can ac\- complish a lot with very little if we work in solidarity towards shared goals\. Dangerous planetary change, uncharted transitions and polarization are making uncertainty more challenging\. Even so, we have more tools than ever to help navigate and course correct, and no amount of technological wizardry is a substi\- tute for good leadership, social cohesion or trust\. If we can start fixing the human side of the planetary ledger—and this Report tries to highlight how—then the future, however uncertain, will be more promise than peril, just as it should be\.

__SPOTLIGHT 6\.1__

##### Principles to be cultivated to navigate uncertainty

Flexibility should be understood as rejecting one\- size\-fits\-all policy solutions and deliberately prac\- ticing iteration, variation and recombination in policymaking\. For instance, chapter 4 builds on the need to upgrade strategies for human security such as strengthening social protection systems with built\- in adaptive capabilities\. Practices such as feedback loops, iterative learning and iterative design can be valuable tools to navigate uncertain contexts and find solutions that adapt best to different contexts and moments\.

A key factor for creating knowledge and transmit\- ting ideas is cumulative cultural evolution\.1 Because evolution does not necessarily mean efficiency and equality of outcomes, it requires strategies to favour flexibility, allowing adaptation to constantly chang\- ing conditions\. But efficiency and flexibility need not be interchangeable in policy outcomes if flexibility is based on dynamic mechanisms to enable change\.2 In fact, a balance of both can be superior in uncertain contexts\.3

Creativity would have a hard time thriving in ho\- mogeneous and rigid contexts, and adequate con\- text\-aware solutions are hard to find through safe repetition of a narrow set of policies\. In chapter 3 suc\- cessful policy reformers were characterized by their willingness to try creative problem\-solving strategies\. Uncertainty means we are always facing new and multifaceted challenges\. Solutions to these challeng\- es can emerge only in environments with matching dynamism\. Chapter 5 points out how our ability to thrive under uncertainty and achieve transformations will depend on creative policy change\. In practice, creativity requires exploring tools and approaches such as iterative learning, diverse perspectives and risk management\. Creativity depends on societies’ interconnectedness, the fidelity of the information and learning transmitted, and cultural trait diversity\.4 Solidarity should be understood as recognizing our interconnectedness\. “Solidarity does not assume that

our struggles are the same struggles, or that our pain is the same pain, or that our hope is for the same fu\- ture\. Solidarity involves commitment, and work, as well as the recognition that even if we do not have the same feelings, or the same lives, or the same bod\- ies, we do live in common ground\.”5 For example, re\- distributive policies such as robust social protection recognize how inequities in agency, freedoms and ca\- pabilities have direct and indirect consequences for all individuals, groups and societies\.

Incorporating solidarity means acknowledging that our lives are interconnected by the multidimensional impacts of our choices and our shared physical, eco\- nomic and social spaces\. In the face of uncertainty, people can turn to default values that go beyond stra\- tegic thinking, and in an environment of trust, the de\- fault can be solidarity \(chapter 4\)\. And transitions to renewable energy can be done in solidarity with the groups and places where the resources reside \(chap\- ter 1\), while unsustainable arrangements could pre\- vent the consolidation of human development gains for everyone\.

Inclusion can enable transformations, as seen in examples throughout the Report\. Chapter 4 high\- lights ensuring access and equity in communications technology\. Chapters 2 and 5 discuss regulating arti\- ficial intelligence to address algorithmic bias and dis\- crimination\. Inclusiveness goes beyond increasing participation and diversity; it requires shifts in insti\- tutions’ norms and attitudes and the cooperation of relevant stakeholders, society and policymakers to address the roots of unequal treatment\.6

These four motivating principles are nonexhaus\- tive, but balancing them could help chart paths to transformation\. Driving transformation requires ac\- knowledging the links and tensions between them\. These principles are not mutually exclusive\. They often coexist and enable each other\. For instance, inclusion can unlock innovation\.7 Exposure to diver\- sity \(of people, practices and institutions\)8 motivates

people to learn,9 and iterative learning is part of innovation\.10

Solidarity and inclusion11 are interdependent\. Sol\- idarity requires recognizing and incorporating the diversity of individuals, groups, perspectives and lived experiences that coexist\. At the same time greater inclusion contributes to solidarity by fight\- ing divisiveness and inequalities\. Social movements can teach us a lot about solidarity in the search for inclusion, leading the way to leave no one behind\. Institutions can support the transformations pushed by social movements and community initiatives by listening to the diverse voices of those whose rights are being abridged, allocating resources and inform\- ing their research agendas to complement collective actions\.12

Beyond the multiple intersections there also might be some tensions between these motivating princi\- ples\. The paradox of diversity represents an example,

as chapter 3 discusses\.13 Cultural trait diversity has perhaps the largest potential to empower creativity because it increases the recombinatorial possibilities\. But it also increases coordination costs due to the multitude of perspectives\. To address this, the cul\- tural evolution approach analyses how high cultural trait diversity allows for an evolution of approaches favouring the traits that best adapt to the current cir\- cumstances,14 understanding that these traits might fall out of favour if the circumstances change\. This re\- quires a high tolerance for diversity, but it also means that there will be inequality of outcomes because some approaches borne out of the recombination might fail and be discarded\. However, the success\- ful ones will spread and benefit all\.15 So, although it is generally possible to align flexibility, creativity, sol\- idarity and inclusion, there is not a straightforward path for them to work together, and tensions might mean compromises along the way\.

##### How local communities confront rapid environmental change

Consider South Africa, where impoverished rural communities have become proactive in improving their quality of life\. Women have organized initiatives that range from local saving clubs and cooperatives to traditional craft and barter systems\.1 For the Zamuk\- phila Women’s Community Project, women in Upsh\- er villages formed a vegetable\-growing community, growing 70 percent to sell on the roadsides and the rest for self\-consumption\. The project received sup\- port from a corporation that allocated a piece of irri\- gated land adjacent to the village, while the women provided fertilizer and seeds\.2

Another project in South Africa—the Mansomani initiative, led by Black women—mobilized communi\- ty support to convert a piece of land into an irrigated sugar cane field and liaise with a local sugar mill\. This helped secure a source of income for community pro\- ducers\. Key success factors were leadership, which persisted for more than 20 years, and external sup\- port\. In this line, external agents, such as nongovern\- mental organizations, or governments can support initiatives sensitive to local needs and aspirations, preserving the community’s agency\.3 Through this

project women used what was already in place—land and irrigation—and invested in crop resources to have more economic independence and be better pre\- pared to face shocks\.

In 2012 a group of practitioners in Democratic Re\- public of the Congo started the African Institute for Integrated Responses to Violence Against Women and HIVAIDS at the Panzi Hospital to research men\- tal health in African contexts\. The hospital partnered with a local feminist organization to provide counsel\- ling and training in Kiswahili\. Capacity building of medical staff along with individual and group coun\- selling sessions using music and dance to facilitate healing and livelihood therapy provided for land and tools for women to restart farming or rebuild assets\.4 Building women’s emotional and economic agen\- cy translated into more inclusion in political spaces, empowering the women to express solidarity by or\- ganizing themselves to raise funds by selling local products\.5 Having the perspective of local women af\- fected by the same structural inequalities facilitated coordination and communication and opened a dif\- ferent array of possible solutions\.

##### How volunteerism, inclusion and deliberation can work as insurance

Volunteerism can be seen as collective insurance rooted in solidarity that can prepare communities for environmental shocks\. In Sudan during seasons of either high demand or drought, communities work together through *nafeer *\(calls to mobilize\), where people help each other plant and harvest crops\. The military engages as well, protecting the harvests from theft and reconstructing mosques and other buildings damaged during conflict\. Without trust, collabora\- tion and communication to build a sense of solidari\- ty, this activity could not be accomplished by just one farmer\. But when people come together, crops can be harvested faster and more productively\.1

Policy mechanisms that favour inclusion typically remove barriers or discriminatory attitudes and be\- haviours to ensure people’s participation in social, economic, political and civic spheres\.2 Equal partici\- pation fosters agency and increases diversity through opportunities and choice\. Inclusion can work as in\- surance\. For example, including smallholder farmers in the design, business models and decisionmaking of digital platform providers would go a long way towards enabling the full potential and benefits of information and communications technology innova\- tions in Africa\.3 There is rising demand for inclusion policies as women, indigenous peoples and migrants continue to be excluded\.4 Since 2017 the Colombian government has provided a special permit to grant Venezuelan immigrants permission to work\. In gener\- al, the programme has expanded access to the labour market, but barriers such as recognition of creden\- tials or access to financial markets persist, limiting the opportunities for immigrant workers\.5 As part of a

set of flexible and inclusive assessment methods, the Netherlands has been working with local migrant and refugee organizations to offer proof of Dutch\-equiva\- lent credentials and facilitate the assessment and rec\- ognition of Syrian nationals’ qualifications\.6

Deliberation can serve as insurance for polariza\- tion7 and is one of the keys to achieving recognition\.8 Although a natural human capacity, deliberation re\- quires intentional and concerted efforts: rules, to prompt inclusive and civil deliberation; stories that make sense, provide meaning and instil a collective sense of commitment; leadership that engages citi\- zens in a deliberative rhetoric; outcomes that matter to people; and the possibility to pass on and learn the skills to instil a culture of deliberation\.9 Deliberation is especially important for enabling public reason\- ing in a participatory and inclusive way, where ideas are represented and put forth by all groups irrespec\- tive of their political, economic or other status \(see chapter 4\)\. Even in the absence of organized deliber\- ation, contact among groups has been shown to de\- crease dehumanization across groups10 and reduce hostility\.11 However, negative contact can exacerbate hostilities,12 pointing to the importance of setting up deliberation and intergroup contact for success through the conditions and settings in which they are encouraged\. Beyond deliberation, voting is effec\- tive as well because it allows citizens to restrain de\- fectors and reassures cooperative citizens that their efforts are not futile\. Accompanying cultural change could consist of a shift in the mindset from exclusive\- ly seeking self\-interest to believing that people can make decisions for the greater good\.13

##### Addressing mental distress:

Capabilities for people and policymakers

Mental distress can become an obstacle to human development under certain circumstances \(see chap\- ter 2\)\. To avoid this, policymakers as well as people themselves can take action and prevent situations that cause mental distress, mitigate crises and build psy\- chological resilience without leaving anyone behind\.

Preventing distress

The first layer of policies to tackle the cycle of distress and constrained human development consists of pre\- venting distress\. Building safe environments through strong national institutions and international cooper\- ation is the ideal setting\. Socioeconomic policymak\- ing can contribute to this goal\. Income support, for instance, has been shown to significantly decrease mental distress of children and young people living in a household\.1 Education is key to empowerment, enabling people to filter good\-quality information out of abundant information during the digital age\. It can also encourage people to take action regarding

globe, crisis prevention may not always be possible in the light of unprecedented threats\. In that case socio\- economic policies can provide transitionary continu\- ity and stability\. During multiple lockdowns caused by the pandemic, economies with strong social con\- tracts and robust social protection schemes caused fewer worries to the people and were less affected by economic consequences\.7 Examples include univer\- sal emergency payments comparable to a temporary universal basic income8 and some traditional social protection policies such as extended sickness bene\- fits, unemployment protection and benefits for fam\- ilies and older people\.9 The pandemic has shown that strong social institutions can help mitigate crises by contributing to stability\. But some of these measures can also help during extreme weather events, when droughts or floods impair harvests, or when liveli\- hoods are damaged during armed conflicts\. Relying on tightly knit social protection schemes assures peo\- ple’s livelihoods and can thus alleviate mental dis\- tress until crises are overcome\.

proving them with ownership and agency to shape their own future\.2 And it can prevent discrimination\.3 Diplomacy and negotiation can prevent some vi\- olent conflicts\. But other conflicts can be stopped from turning violent at a much earlier stage through socially cohesive communities as well as tightly knit support networks\.4 Moreover, social embeddedness

—social connections and interpersonal relationships within social networks and group identities—has been found to reduce stress and anxiety\.5 In the face of threat and uncertainty, cultural norms are crucial to keep societies cohesive and organized\.6

Mitigating crises

As demonstrated by the Covid\-19 pandemic, as well as by multiple extreme weather events around the

Building resilience

Not all uncertainties and crises can be prevented or mitigated, but this does not mean that people have to develop mental disorders\. With universal access to mental health services as well as other culturally aligned resilience building and healing approaches,10 people are often able to absorb mental distress and thrive in the context of uncertainties\. Many of these services could be offered within existing social struc\- tures, such as schools and community centres\.

There is a wide variety of mental health and well\- being interventions, but some have proven especial\- ly effective for distress\. For example, eye movement desensitization and reprocessing has shown signifi\- cant improvement of post\-traumatic stress disorder symptoms,11 including in veterans and children,12 exceeding the success of pharmacotherapy\.13 Yoga

can alleviate anxiety, depression and somatization14 and release stress\-related muscle tensions that can cause migraines\.15 Mindfulness exercises and med\- itation have been used in psychotherapy for a long time,16 and empirical evidence shows that they can improve depression17 and aggressive behaviour\.18 Accessible at large scale, this can break cycles of violence and mental distress— one step towards

building peaceful societies\. More attention needs to be paid to providing universal access to these and other techniques as well as to dismantling stigma\- tization around mental health\. Narratives within the policy discourse can help achieve this and foster hope collectively\.19

##### Social media misinformation and freedom of expression

Social media has transformed the landscape of con\- sumption and diffusion of misinformation\. People can now immediately find and share content with bil\- lions of other users online through platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, Reddit, Snapchat, TikTok, Twitter, WhatsApp and YouTube, among many others\. Publicity, the arts, entertainment, com\- merce, advocacy, education, journalism and even public entities have adapted strategies to reach users in online socialization spaces\. The same applies to the distribution of news\. By 2021 close to 60 percent of users in some world regions were using platforms such as Facebook and WhatsApp to get their news \(figure S6\.5\.1\)\.1

Along with the potential benefits of rapidly ex\- panding virtual social spaces, social media provide fertile ground for spreading misinformation2 and fake news,3 and the targeted and intentional use of platforms to enhance polarization and radicaliza\- tion\.4 Prominent social media platforms have been called to action on this front by users, policymakers, authorities and their own conviction\.

The policy discussion on misinformation often finds tension in the intersection between freedom of expression and both the importance of accurate, veri\- fied and trustworthy diffusion of information and the determination of boundaries of respect and civility in online behaviour\. “We want to help people stay in\- formed without stifling productive public discourse\.

There is also a fine line between false news and sat\- ire or opinion\.”5 “It’s not just what we take down, but how we treat all the content we leave up that gives us the best path forward\. \(…\) An overly aggressive ap\- proach towards removals would also have a chilling effect on free speech\.”6 Big social media platforms now have policies and guidelines on misinformation and have developed varying strategies to combat it, ranging from user\-initiated reporting features to re\- moval of misinformation and restriction of accounts\. Governing bodies, national and international, have shown more interest in the effects of media misinfor\- mation\. The UN Secretary\-General’s Roadmap for Digital Cooperation and the upcoming Global Dig\- ital Compact in the context of the Common Agenda incorporate prioritizing digital trust and security for the present and future of digital development\.7 Poli\- cy recommendations on misinformation at the inter\- national level highlight the importance of protecting human rights and freedom of expression; emphasiz\- ing methods that build trust, media literacy and co\- operation; and emphasizing the dangers of overusing

and misusing censorship\.8

The European Union has increased its regulation on disinformation and the use of social media\. The European Commission developed an action plan that includes a Code of Practice on Disinformation, the European Digital Media Observatory and the Eu\- ropean Democracy Action Plan, with guidelines for

##### Collective action and social movements shaping culture and coping with uncertainty

Whether it pushes to change cultural configurations or attempts to adapt to hardship, collective action has a transformative power that transmits ideas and shapes narratives and perceptions that can be vital for adaptation\.1

In the face of uncertainty and institutional short\- comings,2 feelings of shared discontent and dissat\- isfaction can motivate a push for solidarity within communities or social groups\. This can translate into collective organization and action in search of community resilience and better development out\- comes\. Social movements are a clear example of how people’s choices have supported transformations\. Throughout history the world has witnessed the power of social movements, where people connected by a shared purpose or common identity have trig\- gered transformational change for entire societies\.3

A wide range of social movements develop because of unmet expectations and moral beliefs of fairness and social justice\.4 Some do so through collective identity\.5 In all cases the process is linked to emotions and cultural ideas with the power to transform a per\- sonal goal or interest, to adopt the goals and interests of a group\.6 Individuals involving themselves in a so\- cial movement develop a shared normative perspec\- tive or shared concerns for change that give them a sense of common purpose\.7

Individuals join social movements and sustain their mobilization because of rational, emotional, be\- havioural, leadership, organizational and social\-nor\- mative factors\.8 Even though emotions are present in every phase of the lifecycle of a social movement9 and they positively motivate individuals, they have often been dismissed or unjustly judged by outsid\- ers\.10 For instance, protestors are often portrayed as irrational or immature,11 hostile or violent, or as need\- ing to be disciplined\.12 The study of emotions in pol\- itics and social movements emerged to recognize that emotions permeate any political action,13 shape movements’ goals and determine their success\. This

analysis can provide insights to necessary changes for transformation by encouraging new ways of thinking and approaching policy mechanisms\.

For a social movement to succeed, one of the most important factors is for it to lead towards so\- cial change and transformation as well as strategic choices\.14 Social movements can emerge when a large group of people become distressed by a particular situation or driven by leaders who mobilize people and facilitate broader awareness of concerns, then coalesce when they become more organized to raise awareness and mobilize resources\. After formal and informal institutions take notice of a movement and bureaucratize it, a social movement can follow sever\- al paths before starting to decline \(figure S6\.6\.1\)\.15

Successful social movements have demonstrated a commitment to changing norms and attitudes, not just policy reforms\. For instance, LGBTQI\+ advo\- cates used polling research to reframe public cam\- paign messages on rights to include wording on love and commitment as well; this eventually turned into the “Love is love” slogan and contributed to change in marriage laws\.16

The frequency of social protests increased by an av\- erage of 11\.5 percent a year between 2009 and 2019 across all regions of the world, with the largest con\- centration of activity in the Middle East and North Africa and the fastest growth in Sub\-Saharan Africa\.17 The Covid\-19 pandemic halted mass protests from March to May 2020, but rather than disappearing, so\- cial movements adapted to the pandemic measures and bounced back as restrictions eased\.18

Identity social movements arise to challenge tra\- ditional understandings of power distribution and reframe how certain groups are perceived\. These movements aim to reclaim and transform narratives around identity for a group that has been historical\- ly discriminated against and oppressed\. Confront\- ing traditional beliefs and behaviours constitutes a reclaim of power and provides a sense of agency,

pride, self\-confidence and equality\.19 This type of movement is both reformative and transformative, as it looks to expand opportunities but also freedoms\. Take the example of the feminist movement \(spot\- light 6\.7\)\.

Although powerful in their transformative capacity and as examples of in\-group solidarity, identity\-based struggles may also reify adversarial narratives be\- tween groups and reaffirm structural and social divi\- sions based on certain identity dimensions\. This can bring about challenges in broader global cooperation and can lead to violence and conflict\. It can also over\- shadow the freedom that exists within self\-identifica\- tion and the overlapping multidimensional identities across the world\. This is especially concerning for movements that seek to encroach on the freedoms of others\. As argued in chapter 3, key to address\- ing these challenges is recognizing that each person comprises multiple, overlapping identities that can acquire different salience depending on context and can change over time\.

Social movements’ enduring impacts permeate cultural repertoires and transform societies\. They can change the way we live, make us question tra\- ditional beliefs, reposition identities and eliminate

stereotypes and prejudices\. The policy changes that have emerged from protests and movements have de\- pended on broad changes in public attitudes\.20 Mobi\- lizations change culture through different channels: public opinion, memories, language and lifestyle, the media, and political and nonpolitical institutions\.21 They are a way to give momentum and directionali\- ty to the feedback cycle between social attitudes and norms and institutional and policy responses\.

The nature and tone of media coverage can shift public opinion perceptions, even if indirectly\. A study documenting public opinion change as an outcome of the feminist movement in the United States ar\- gues that the media coverage had a significant effect on gender attitudes, such that the public started re\- considering traditional roles and adopting alterna\- tive views\.22 Although traditional news outlets still dominate news gathering in Europe and the United States23 and have a strong influence over politics, so\- cial media has impacted these dynamics significant\- ly in recent years as the circulation of news stories is increasingly featured on platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, Twitter and YouTube\. Through media and social media, activists have defied tra\- ditional portrayals of groups, combated stigma and

increased the representation of groups among writ\- ers, producers and performers\.24 More decentralized and open access to media has increased the rep\- resentation and diversity of perspectives on a plat\- form\. But it has also raised concerns about the quality of information and the need for tools to filter, discern and manage violence, hate and misinformation\. In these contexts there is a risk for some forms of social movements to spread misinformation and promote forms of injustice, domination and oppression\.

Changes in day\-to\-day behaviours, such as life\- style or language, are other channels for movements to trigger change\. The changes in the law for same\- sex marriage has triggered rapid shifts in attitudes\. Combined with the activism of LGBTQI\+ rights movement, the changes have combatted stigma, re\- framed gender as a social construct and incorporat\- ed inclusive language and gender\-neutral pronouns for nonbinary and queer people\.25 However, in some countries where third\-gender categories have been officially recognized for decades, many LGBTQI\+ activists are campaigning against the forceful impo\- sition of third\-gender pronouns, highlighting the im\- portance of people having the agency to determine their own identity rather than having it imposed on them by outside actors\.26 Thanks to the feminist movement the terms machismo or male chauvinist, feminist and sexist have become more widely used and understood\.27

Other movements such as those linked to environ\- mentalism and social justice have produced lifestyle changes in societies where they are most promi\- nent\.28 People modify their behaviour to be coherent across their ideologies, values and actions\. Exam\- ples of changes in daily behaviours include boycott\- ing firms that do not comply with raised standards for sustainable behaviour\. These conscious consum\- ers are more likely to become politically active29 and can present incentives for businesses to increasing\- ly declare and act on their social and environmental principles with more inclusive and sustainable prac\- tices\.30 Local communities are transforming practic\- es for sustainable food systems as well\. Indigenous communities have learned how to live off the earth without damaging the integrity of ecosystems\. Māori and Quechua communities have built a platform to reclaim cultural rights over food landscapes by pro\- moting collective rights and responsibilities over land and food, based on their community practices to pre\- serve agrobiodiversity\.31

When individuals belonging to a community per\- ceive that government institutions or authorities are unreliable and unsupportive, policies and regula\- tion might seem insufficient\. This creates a need for action, and collaboration is used as a coping mech\- anism\.32 In these contexts social movements are rooted in solidarity, key for overcoming injustice, domination and oppression\.33

##### Feminist mobilizations defying gender social norms

Women’s and feminist movements have advanced women’s rights across a variety of issues, both nation\- ally and globally\. Feminist mobilizations are associat\- ed with better legal rights to participate in economic life, greater representation in politics, better support for paid and unpaid domestic care work, better pro\- tection from sexual harassment, better access to land tenure, financial inclusion,1 overcoming stigma and raising awareness around violence against women and girls\.2 Feminist mobilizations have grown across every Human Development Index \(HDI\) group\. Low and medium HDI countries have seen the great\- est increases in autonomy and strength of feminist movements \(figure S6\.7\.1\)\. Low HDI countries that have seen a greater increase in feminist movements

South Asia and Latin America have had the highest Feminist Mobilization Index scores on av\- erage since 1995, while the Arab States have had the lowest\.

Feminist mobilizations defy stereotypes, redefine boundaries and expand agency for women and girls\. They can open pathways to enhanced wellbeing and agency for women occupying spaces in all spheres of life, using their voices to bring new perspectives, participate equally in society and hold governments and others in positions of power accountable\. Coun\- tries with powerful feminist movements or higher women’s representation in parliaments adopted an average of five more gender\-sensitive measures in response to the Covid\-19 pandemic than countries without these features\.3 Activists in these countries developed feminist plans and gender budget assess\- ments in addition to demanding action to address violence against women and girls and to improve ac\- cess to public services\. Two examples are the Gender and Covid\-19 Roundtable with 79 civil society organ\- izations in Chile4 and the Women’s Caucus in Brazil’s legislature5 \(Bancada Feminina\) advocating for facil\- ities that aid women and girls who are subject to vio\- lence to be declared essential public services\.

Women’s participation in social movements has promoted changes in traditional gender norms through two main pathways: policy reforms and re\- framing gender roles and power relations\.6 Coun\- tries with a lower presence of women’s movements or protests \(as measured by the Feminist Mobiliza\- tion Index\) have the highest biases against gender equality and women’s empowerment \(as measured by the Gender Social Norms Index; figure S6\.7\.2; see also box S6\.7\.1\)\. The elevated risks and costs of women mobilizing in these contexts are probably

much higher, feeding into a vicious cycle\. The asso\- ciation between the presence of biases and lower feminist mobilization appears in political and eco\- nomic dimensions: in countries with lower feminist mobilizations, almost 50 percent of people think men make better political leaders and more than 40 per\- cent think they make better business executives than women\.

How are biases against gender equality and women’s empowerment changing? The 2022 Gender Social Norms Index

Gender inequalities persist, and recent shocks, in\- cluding planetary imbalances, the Covid\-19 pan\- demic and economic crises, are aggravating the current scenario for women all over the world\. The Gender Inequality Index \(GII\) reveals a lack of glob\- al improvement in its dimensions, with the world value stagnating at 0\.465 for the past three years\. Alarmingly, all regions experienced a decline in GII value from 2019 to 2020 except South Asia, which

experienced an increase; from 2020 to 2021 all re\- gions except the Arab States and East Asia and the Pacific registered a decline\.7 While women have seen some progress in basic capabilities, there are still challenges in areas that involve greater agency and power\. In 59 countries adult women are more edu\- cated than adult men\. In those same countries the income gender gap is 39 percent\.8 Behind these cal\- culations social norms help us understand these dy\- namics of power imbalances\.

According to the Gender Social Norms Index, 91 percent of men and 88 percent of women show at least one clear bias against gender equality in areas such as politics, economics, education, inti\- mate partner violence and women’s reproductive rights \(figure S6\.7\.3; see also box S6\.7\.1\)\. Men have high biases in thinking that men make better polit\- ical leaders than women do \(52\.8 percent\) and that men should have more right to a job than women \(50\.2 percent\)\. Women present fewer biases across all dimensions\.

This year’s Gender Social Norms Index results pro\- vide hope, showing an improvement from the first

For each indicator a variable takes the value of 1 when an individual has a bias and 0 when the individual does not\. The core index value is an aggregation based on the “union approach,” which measures the percentage of people with biases, independent of the number of biases\. In many instances it might take only one bias from one person to block a woman’s progress in society\.

This year’s index covers two sets of countries and territories\. The first set consists of countries and territories with data for wave 5 \(2005–2009\), wave 6 \(2010–2014\) or wave 7 \(2017–2022\) of the World Values Survey \(accessed April 2022\) and uses the latest data available\. This set includes 76 countries and territories, accounting for more than 84 percent of the global population\. The second set consists of only countries and territories with data for wave 6 and wave 7\. This set includes 37 countries and territories, accounting for 48 percent of the global population\.

time it was calculated\. On average, biases against gender equality and women’s empowerment de\- clined from 2010–2014 to 2017–2022 \(table S6\.7\.1\)\.

Most countries and territories with time\-series data showed progress: women in 23 countries and territo\- ries and men in 26 countries and territories showed reduced biases against gender equality and women’s empowerment \(figure S6\.7\.4\)\. Progress in the share of people with no bias was greater in Germany, New Zealand, Singapore and Japan\. But there were rever\- sals in several countries, among women in 14 coun\- tries and men in 11 countries\. The greatest reversals took place in the Republic of Korea, Mexico, Chile and Iraq\.

Expanding human development and drawing cultural change in a patriarchal society

In line with the two\-tier framework presented in chapter 6, the different policy blocks can support the task of defying gender social norms\. Investing in gender\-sensitive responses to shocks, especially initiatives that build partnerships between govern\- ments and civil society,9 can help women better cope with uncertainty\. Strengthening and expanding so\- cial protection systems to cover women can work as insurance, increasing their bargaining power at the household level, promoting financial inclusion, sup\- porting long\-term income generation and building

__OVERVIEW __

1. Cognizant of ongoing discussions about whether the Anthropocene can be defined as a new geological epoch, the Report adopts the perspective of the Anthropocene as an ongoing geological event \(Bauer and others 2021\.\) as well as a historical event\. As Wagner\- Pacifici \(2017, p\. 1\) argues: “Historical events provoke an enormous sense of uncertainty\. The world seems out of whack, and everyday routines are, at the least, disrupted\. People often experience a vertiginous sensation that a new reality or era may be in the making, but it is one that does not yet have a clear shape and trajectory, or determined consequences\. \[Events imply a\] complex dynamic of ‘unknow\- ing’ and then reknowing a world transformed by events\.” With relevance to the layer of uncertainty associated with the Anthropo\- cene emphasized in the Report, the author continues: “\[P\]lanetary environmental crisis is an event in which the ground *becomes *the event\.” \(Wagner\-Pacifici 2017, p\. 165\)\.

23. These two layers of uncertainty echo the framing emanating from assessments of the implications of climate change for financial stability \(see, for instance, BIS 2021\), which distinguishes between two sources of risk when it comes to valuing assets: physical risks and transition risks\. Physical risks are associated with how hazards exacerbated by climate change can lower asset values—for instance, how floods can lower the value of houses located near the sea or in flood\-prone areas\. Transition risks are associated with changes in regulation or consumer tastes that can result in stranded assets—for instance, if coal\-fired power plants are forbidden or rejected by consumers, the value of coal min\- ing and coal\-fired power plants can collapse\. Chapter 1 extends this framework by looking beyond physical risks of climate change to consider the broader set of challenges asso\- ciated with the Anthropocene context and by looking beyond the climate transition to con\- sider the broader set of elements associated with a transition to ease planetary pressures\.

__CHAPTER 1__

1. At the start of 2022, UN Secretary\-General

the probability distributions associated with them \(even though there are disagreements over what the probability distribution is\)\. In this context climate change is a source, or driver, of uncertainty, not because we do not know that something bad might happen and not even because we cannot estimate how likely it is for that to happen, but because future outcomes are not certain but rather are defined today in probabilistic terms\. Crucially,

of our climate, which makes future outcomes contingent on our choices, among other

our own actions can \(still\) shape the direction		

things\. Probabilities associated with uncertain		

events can be estimated in different ways\. For recurrent events frequency of past events is a common approach, including in the insur\- ance industry\. For rare or unprecedented future events models or expert elicitation can suggest distributions associated with future events\. When no probability distribution can be derived for future events that can be specified, we confront choice under ambigu\- ity\. And, of course, there is also the possibility

1. For example, Ahir, Bloom and Furceri \(2022\) constructed a World Uncertainty Index based on text analysis of Economist Intelligence Unit reports\. They found that concerns about un\- certainty have been steadily increasing since 2012, with the onset of the Covid\-19 pandemic prompting a historical peak of the index\.

5. Maurer and Holbach 2016\. See also Com\- putational Story Lab \(n\.d\.\) on the influence of events on expressions of happiness on Twitter\.
6. The findings are akin to other studies that show growing public discontent and serious deteriorations in social attitudes towards democracy, science and governments \(EIU 2021; Foa and others 2020; Institute for Eco\- nomics & Peace 2020\)\.

António Guterres warned world leaders of

of confronting an event that has never been		

increasing divergence between countries, prompting a “recipe for instability” \(UN 2022a\), echoing the need to strengthen multilateral\- ism to meet humanity’s greatest challenges, which was set out in the Secretary\-General’s report *Our Common Agenda *\(UN 2021c\)\.

1. For example, the Covid\-19 pandemic forced an unprecedented human development reversal, with decreases in life expectancy at birth for two consecutive years \(UNDP 2022b\)\. Some 1\.3 billion people live in multi\- dimensional poverty, as of 2021 \(UNDP and OPHI 2020\)\. And inequalities across groups and in important aspects of human develop\- ment are on the rise \(UNDP 2019\)\.
2. Uncertainty has been defined as the topic of the decade by International Monetary Fund Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva 2020\): “If I had to identify a theme at the out\- set of the new decade, it would be increasing uncertainty\.” A time of shifting geopolitics, increasing instability and global tensions has also been identified by United Nations Secu\- rity Council \(2021\)\.
3. UNDP 2022b\. For further evidence on dis\- content, anxieties and feelings of insecurity, including in some of the richest countries in the world, see Pinto and others \(2022\), Pew Research Center \(2021\) and UNDP \(2022b\)\.
4. “Uncertainty” is used in this chapter and in the Report to refer to a broad set of pos\- sible future outcomes that are not known in advance with certitude\. In economics there is a long tradition of thinking about uncertainty, as in the contributions by Keynes \(1909\) and Knight \(1921\)\. Today, the economics literature on choice under uncertainty distinguishes between choice under risk \(when there is a probability distribution associated with a set of possible events\) and choice under ambigu\- ity \(when the set of possible events is known but the probability distribution is unknown\)\. Choices on climate change mitigation are typically analysed as choices under risk, giv\- en that a set of possible outcomes is known and there are different ways of estimating

imagined\. All these possibilities fall under the broad umbrella of uncertainty in this Report\.

1. These two layers of uncertainty echo the framing emanating from assessments of the implications of climate change for financial stability \(see, for instance, BIS 2021\), which distinguish between two sources of risk when it comes to valuation of assets: physical risks and transition risks\. Physical risks are as\- sociated with how hazards exacerbated by climate change can lower asset values—for instance, how floods can lower the value of houses located near the sea or in flood\-prone areas\. Transition risks are associated with changes in regulation or consumer tastes that can result in stranded assets—for instance, if coal\-fired power plants are either forbidden or rejected by consumers, the value of coal mining and coal\-fired power plants can col\- lapse\. This chapter extends this framework by looking beyond physical risks of climate change to consider the broader set of chal\- lenges associated with the Anthropocene context, as well as looking beyond the cli\- mate transition to consider the broader set of elements associated with a transition to ease planetary pressures\.

13. Pinto and others 2022\. For example, a recent study found that a majority of people in 17 ad\- vanced economies believe that the children growing up today will be financially worse off than their parents \(Pew Research Center 2021\)\. Yet other studies point towards young people holding more optimistic views of their future and the future of the world, at least prior to the Covid\-19 pandemic \(Ipsos and Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation 2018\), particu\- larly those in developing countries \(UNICEF 2021a\)\.

25. The final adoption of a new epoch by the stratigraphic community remains under con\- sideration \(Voosen 2022a\)\. The proposal was formally put forward by a working group set up to consider the evidence in favour of a new geological epoch \(Zalasiewicz and oth\- ers 2017\)\. Recently, a suggestion was made to characterize the Anthropocene as an unfold\- ing geological event, rather than a geological epoch with clear markers \(Bauer and others 2021\)\. See the 2020 Human Development

<a id="_bookmark124"></a>Report \(UNDP 2020a\) for a review of the evidence, as well as the debate from multiple perspectives from the natural sciences, social sciences and humanities that the Anthropo\- cene frame has motivated\.

1. UNDP 2020a\.
2. The argument that having power over some\- thing creates an obligation to act \(either towards improving an outcome or stop some\- thing that is harmful\) has a long tradition in ethical reasoning\. For instance, it was invoked by Buddha as the argument for why humans should not harm nonhuman life\. This example and argument draw from Sen \(2009b\)\.

Without stark action, human\-induced emis\- sions are expected to increase average tem\- peratures by 1\.5°C within the next 20 years, with potential catastrophic consequences for humans \(IPCC 2021\)\.

25. Climate simulations are susceptible to an inherent model uncertainty—across and within models \(Barnett, Brock and Hansen 2020\)\. Some major sources of uncertainty are derived from the evolution of greenhouse gas emissions—which will be influenced by human choices and policies—and the feed\- back loops between different ecosystem processes \(Hausfather and others 2022\)\. For example, implementing a carbon tax will im\- pact the cost of carbon, influence consump\- tion and production choices and ultimately affect emissions\. But the optimal rate of such a tax is difficult to identify, due to uncertainty about the true social cost of carbon \(Bar\- nett, Brock and Hansen 2020\) and whether

people will accept such a tax \(see, for ex\- ample, the “yellow vest” fuel tax protests in France\)\. Thus, the assumptions made when projecting future temperatures may lead to vastly different conclusions \(Hausfather and others 2022\), and researchers have been raising a warning flag for a new generation of “hot models” that overestimate temperature increases \(Voosen 2022b\)\. Averaging projec\- tions from different models is one way to deal with model uncertainty, but too\-hot models may exaggerate the impact of emissions on warming\. The latest IPCC report instead mod\- elled results based on different degrees of warming, again illustrating the wide range of possible outcomes\. Inherent uncertainty in cli\- mate models does not mean that warming is not happening; indeed, the latest IPCC report shows that average temperatures on Earth are now 1°C higher than before the Industrial Revolution, which without reasonable doubt is due to human\-induced emissions \(IPCC 2021\)\. How emissions will evolve going forward, and what their impact will be on temperatures and the planet, is largely up to us\.

1. See for example, the latest IPCC report, which integrates cross\-disciplinary insights into the assessments of climate change risks\. Based on an understanding of the interdependent adaptation of human societies and ecosys\- tems, the report shows that—in the context of climate change—human responses to climate change add new layers of opportunity and risk \(IPCC 2022b\)\.
2. Dosio and others 2018\.
3. History can provide important insights\. Sometimes history is invoked to provide cautionary tales for today’s world based on narratives of ecocides in the past, in which “civilizational collapse” was the outcome of overusing natural resources\. A popular read\- ing of this narrative was based on Diamond \(2005\)\. Recognizing that “\[t\]he chief practical use of history is to deliver us from plausible historical analogies” \(James Bryce, cited in Müller 2002, p\. 5\), a more recent account of the historical record, made possible in part by advances in technologies ranging from Earth observation to the analysis of DNA deep into the past, suggests that this account has been oversimplified\.

13. For example, pollution is a major health threat, causing one in six deaths every year\. Over time, there has been a decrease in poverty\-related pollution\-related deaths, such as death due to polluted drinking water, but deaths due pollution from industrialization, such as toxic chemicals, have increased by

more than 60 percent since the start of the 21st century, indicating that new gaps in pollu\- tion inequality are opening \(Fuller and others 2022\)\.

10. A scenario where the world at large meets targets set by the Paris Agreement by under\- taking national reforms in a steady, steadfast manner will pose different transitional risks compared with a scenario where changes take place abruptly\. In an adverse scenario, where changes are too late and too sudden, transitional uncertainties will be amplified, transcending through different parts of our economy and society \(Gros and others 2016\)\.
11. UNDP 2020a\.
12. One way of taking an integrated perspective on the multiple transitions to ease planetary pressures and incorporating the role of tech\- nological change is to draw on the approach of the 2020 Human Development Report \(UNDP 2020a\)\. Every form of life uses energy and materials and sends them back to nature, but the footprint of humans far exceeds that of any other species\. For most of human history, the use of energy and materials was not too far from the limits of their biological metabo\- lism; it was not until the Industrial Revolution that humans began to capture and use energy and materials at a scale comparable to the biosphere\.

__CHAPTER 2__

1. Distress is defined as “the negative stress response, often involving negative affect and physiological reactivity: a type of stress that results from being overwhelmed by demands, losses, or perceived threats\.” It implies “a negative emotional state in which the spe\- cific quality of the emotion is unspecified or unidentifiable” \(American Psychological As\- sociation 2022\)\.
2. These concepts are based on Sen \(1999\)\.
3. Mani and others 2013; Ridley and others 2020; WHO 2022b\.
4. Martha Nussbaum and others have repeat\- edly argued that emotions are crucial in the

debate of human development\. Nussbaum considers emotions one of her 10 fundamen\- tal capabilities, pointing out the importance of love, grief, longing, gratitude and justified an\- ger without having these emotions distorted by fear and anxiety \(Nussbaum 2003a\)\. Other important works include Comim \(2011\), Hirai, Comim and Ikemoto \(2016\) and Nussbaum \(1995, 2003b\)\.

1. Pessoa 2019\.
2. The influence of culture has been well estab\- lished in the literature for decades\. Not only do different cultures have different “tool kits” with habits, skills and styles that people use to develop action strategies, but most important, patterns of human thought develop in cul\- tural settings, shaping the functioning of our minds\. In unsettled times culture also shapes people’s behaviour through persisting ide\- ologies that people apply to determine their actions \(Lamont and others 2017; Nisbett and Norenzayan 2002; Swidler 1986; Tomasello

2016\)\.

1. The literature finds, for instance, that fearful people have a stronger risk aversion than angry people, who tend to make risk\-seeking choices \(Lerner and Keltner 2001\)\.
2. Gordon and Mendes 2021\.
3. Human development is the process of enlarg\- ing people’s choices so that each and every individual can develop his or her full potential \(UNDP 1990\)\.
4. The concept of resilience is used in many dif\- ferent ways in the psychology literature but is used here in the sense of mental immunity, in which people do not develop mental disor\- ders despite facing toxic stress \(Davydov and others 2010\)\.

16. Basic trust refers to the trust that is developed during infancy when needs are met by care\- givers\. The baby develops trust in itself, the world and those who surround it\. This trust develops further during childhood, when children can consistently rely on caregivers \(Erikson 1993\)\.

33. A recent survey involving 10,000 young people \(ages 16\-25\) from 10 countries from around the world found that over 60 percent of young people are sad, afraid or anxious about climate change\. Many of them feel that governments are failing young people \(65 percent\) or are even lying about the impact of their actions in response to climate change \(64 percent\)\.

Interactions between biodiversity and mental wellbeing remain poorly understood, with studies con\- ducted among wealthier populations yielding mixed and inconclusive results \(Hedin and others 2022; IPBES 2019a; Marselle and oth\- ers 2019\)\.

Even prior to the Covid\-19 pandemic, women had already assumed the lion’s share of unpaid care work, and given containment measures, they shouldered even more re\- sponsibilities trying to tend to their children while working remotely, in some cases \(An\- drew and others 2020; Power 2020; Seedat and Rondon 2021; UN Women 2021b\)\.

Similarly, another study from Malawi shows how uncon\- ditional cash transfers improve mental health among young people, especially among young women \(Angeles and others 2019\)\. In a different setting unconditional cash transfers in Zambia did not reduce stress levels, even though stress levels were highly correlated with perceived food insecurity, which was improved by the extra income \(Hjelm and oth\- ers 2017\)\. The positive effect of cash transfers on mental wellbeing is also valid for adults in low\- and middle\-income countries \(McGuire, Kaiser and Bach\-Mortensen 2022\)\.

31. Lund and others 2010\. When comparing socioeconomic status within countries, people with low socioeconomic status in de\- veloped countries suffer higher psychological burden than people with low socioeconomic in developing countries\. Religion may play a role in this association, as religious norms al\- leviate the burden of poverty \(Berkessel and others 2021\)\. In countries with a strong long\- standing presence of Christian churches, one of the cultural differences that was identified with respect to other countries was less con\- formity and more individualism among people

<a id="_bookmark128"></a>\(Gelfand 2019\)\. Alternative or complementary explanations, apart from church influence, are the effect of perceived inequality, social comparison and peer pressure that cause psychological burden for the low\-income population in some developed countries \(Wilkinson and Pickett 2009\)\.

1. Pleeging, Burger and van Exel 2021\. Educa\- tion and political systems seem to play a role in the relation among believe, hope and well\- being\. Case and Deaton \(2015, 2020\) find that “deaths of despair” \(deaths due to substance abuse or suicide\) have risen substantially among the middle\-aged White working popu\- lation without college degree in the United States since the 1990s\. The authors make psychological distress partly caused by the capitalist system responsible for this develop\- ment\. However, parts of their argument have been contested\. Ruhm \(2018\)’s study of differ\- ent counties in the United States argues that the effect of economic decline on mortality is minimal\.
2. Loibl and others 2021\.
3. Evidence for the United States has consis\- tently shown that college graduates who begin their working lives in a recession earn less for up to 15 years than those that start work when an economy is expanding \(Kahn 2010; Oreopoulos, von Wachter and Heisz 2012; Oyer 2006; Wozniak 2010\)\. This effect is magnified for high school graduates, and the negative effects extend beyond income, also affecting health, leading to higher mor\- tality than those who enter the labour force during prosperous times \(Schwandt and Von Wachter 2019, 2020\)\.

Similarly, a retrospective cohort study in the United Kingdom found that women who had been exposed to intimate partner violence were nearly three times as likely to be diagnosed with mental disorders, almost twice as likely to suffer from anxiety and three times as likely to be depressed as unexposed women \(Chandan and others 2020\)\.

__CHAPTER 3__

1. Institutions in the broadest sense, as pro\- posed by Douglass North to represent formal rules as well as social norms and expecta\- tions \(North 1990\), and including social ar\- rangements that take the form of regulations and other public policies\.
2. One approach would be to assume how people behave and then define an ideal set of institutions that would deliver intended outcomes based on those behavioural assumptions\. “There is a long tradition in economic and social analysis of identify\- ing the realization of justice with what is taken to be the right institutional structure\. There are a great many examples of such a concentration on institutions, with powerful advocacy for alternative institutional visions of a just society, varying from the panacea of wonderfully performing free markets and free trade to the Shangri\-La of socially owned means of production and magically efficient central planning\. There are, however, good evidential reasons to think that none of these grand institutional formulae typically deliver what their visionary advocates hope, and that their actual success in generating good social

<a id="_bookmark130"></a>realizations is thoroughly contingent on vary\- ing social, economic, political and cultural circumstances” \(Sen 2009b, p\. 83\)\. Thus, this approach, always fraught, may be particularly unsuited to novel uncertain times in which a fundamental transformation is being pursued\.

[3](#_bookmark62)	Sen 2009b\.

1. This argument is based on Sen \(2009b\), contrasting contractual approaches to justice, exemplified by several theories of the social contract, with an approach based on social choice, in which the world is constantly as\- sessed, and injustices are addressed through public reasoning that determines institutions and behaviour\.
2. Recognizing that capabilities are not the only thing that matters\. International cooperation for development and social and economic policies often focus on one aspect of capa\- bilities: the deprivations and inequalities in opportunities leading to achievements in wellbeing, such as having income to meet ba\- sic standards of living and being healthy and educated enough to participate in economic,

field that were recognized with a Nobel Prize “Maps of Bounded Rationality\.”

1. While the standard economic model includes social determinants \(that is, elements that are shared and not attached exclusively to agents\), they are typically limited to either prices or the “rules of the game” that may be in place to constrain choice\. The rules of the game are often equated with institutions, in the broad sense proposed by North \(1990\) to represent formal rules as well as social norms and expectations\. They are part of indi\- vidual beliefs that enter rational choice\. For a broader discussion of the \(underappreciated\) relevance of beliefs, see Basu \(2018\)\. As Hoff and Stiglitz \(2016\) argue, these social determi\- nants influence only the choice sets available to agents, not any social determinants of the actual choice\.
2. Granovetter 1985, 2005\. More recently, Greif and Mokyr \(2017, p\. 25\) argued that beliefs \(which Douglass North assumed to be individ\- ually held\) are actually socially constructed on the basis of cognitive rules that “summarize society’s beliefs and experience\.”
3. Hoff and Stiglitz 2016\.
4. Some interesting evidence about the rel\- evance of reference points comes from the times that marathon runners take to complete the course, which are significantly bunched around round numbers \(that is, at 3 hours, 3\.5 hours and so on; Allen and others 2017\)\.
5. Unlike what is assumed in expected utility theory, as described in spotlight 3\.3 \(Tversky and Kahneman 1974\)\.
6. The neural basis for loss aversion is docu\- mented in Tom and others \(2007\)\. On the role of the amygdala in the brain, see Martino, Camerer and Adolphs \(2010\), but for cau\- tion interpreting some of this evidence, see Eklund, Nichols and Knutsson \(2016\)\.
7. Frank 2020\.
8. Tversky and Kahneman 1974\. The refer\- ence point that people use to make these valuations can be based on either something people actually have or some expectation about what they believe may or should hap\- pen \(Kőszegi and Rabin 2006, 2007\)\.

social and political life\. There is good reason		

1. Samuelson and Zeckhauser 1988\.

for this focus when the claims for assistance from others or from the state are associated with deprivations in these capabilities\. This focus assumes even greater force when someone is living in extreme poverty or suf\- fering from hunger\. Human Development Reports over the years have emphasized wellbeing achievements associated with ba\- sic capabilities in standards of living, health or education—also the inspiration for the Human Development Index \(HDI\)\. The HDI provides a natural way to compare countries and as\- sess development progress over time, in a more informationally plural way than relying narrowly on national income\. The reversal in HDI values documented in chapter 1 shows how important it is to continue pursuing this emphasis\.

1. “The possibilities of affecting human behav\- iour through means other than economic incentives may be a great deal more substan\- tial than is typically assumed in the economic literature\. The rigid correspondence between choice, preferences, and welfare assumed in traditional economic theory makes the analysis simpler but also rules out important avenues of social and economic change” \(Sen 1973, p\. 254\)\.
2. Rational in quotation marks to signify the nar\- row perspective that assumes that people be\- have rationally only if they behave according to these assumptions\. Behaviour deviating from these assumptions does not imply that it is irrational, only that it does not conform to the assumptions\.
3. As early as 1955, Herbert Simon \(1955, p\. 99\) wrote: “Broadly stated, the task is to replace the global rationality of economic man with the kind of rational behaviour that is compat\- ible with the access to information and the computational capacities that are actually possessed by organisms, including man, in the kinds of environments in which such organisms exist\.” Daniel Kahneman \(2003\), a leading contributor to behavioural science, titled his review of his contributions to the
4. For many years some of these findings were popularized among economists in a feature of the *Journal of Economic Perspectives *titled “Anomalies\.” In one of the contributions, it was explained that “economics can be distinguished from other social sciences by the belief that most \(all?\) behaviour can be explained by assuming that rational agents with stable, well\-defined preferences interact in markets that \(eventually\) clear\. An empirical result qualifies as an anomaly if it is difficult to ‘rationalize’ or if implausible assumptions are necessary to explain it within the paradigm” \(Rabin and Thaler 2001, p\. 219\)\. An early re\- view of the impact of a more complex under\- standing of human psychology in economics is Rabin \(1998\)\. A more recent review of the field is Thaler \(2018\)\. Implications for devel\- opment economics have been reviewed in World Bank \(2015\), Demeritt and Hoff \(2018\) and Kremer, Rao and Schilbach \(2019\)\.
5. \[Economic analysis\] “underestimates that \[a human\] is a social animal and that his choices are not rigidly bound to his own preferences only\. I do not find it difficult to believe that birds and bees and dogs and cats do reveal their preferences by their choice; it is with human beings that the proposition is not particularly persuasive\. An act of choice for this social animal is, in a fundamental sense, always a social act” \(Sen 1973, pp\. 252–253\)\.

16. Narrow framing was proposed to account for the evaluation of a specific risk separately from other risks, along with insights from prospect theory by Benartzi and Thaler \(1995\) to explain the equity premium puzzle \(the fact that average returns on risky assets such as real estate and stocks historically exceed those of safe assets such as short\-term bonds\) by much more than expected utility theory would predict\.

14. For an argument as to how epistemic norms are social norms, see Henderson \(2020\)\. Levy \(2022, p\. xiii\) puts it succinctly: “\[T\]hose who come to hold bad beliefs do so for roughly the same sorts of reasons as those who come to hold good beliefs\. It isn’t because they’re irrational and we’re not\. It is largely because we defer to reliable sources of evidence and they defer to unreliable\. This deference, which may be explicit or implicit, is itself rational on both sides\. Given that we’re epis\- temically social animals, it’s largely through deference that we come to know about the world and generate further knowledge\.”

1. See, for instance, Sharot and Sunstein \(2020\)\. Box\-Steffensmeier and others \(2022\) provide a review of emerging findings and directions for future research on the understanding of human behaviour\.
2. As Sen \(2009a, p\. 288\) wrote: “Once the priority of a social affiliation \(chosen or un\- chosen\) is accepted as an integral part of one’s ‘overall identity,’ something substantial is lost\. This includes the ability to recognize easily that one has to decide on one’s social affiliations, which does not compromise one’s personal identity\.”
3. Henrich and others \(2022\) review evidence of how many cognitive biases vary across societies, with some disappearing or revers\- ing, including overconfidence, risk aversion, the gambler’s fallacy, the hot hand fallacy, the representative heuristic, neglecting re\- gression to the mean, functional fixity and the endowment effect\. A more nuanced view is that some features are universal, but their manifestations vary across cultures\. For instance, hyperbolic discounting \(discounting the immediate future more than the far future\) was shown to be present in 53 countries but with great heterogeneity for shorter time horizons across countries \(Wang, Rieger and Hens 2016\)\. They also appear to vary across people depending on measures of analytical sophistication and education level \(Frederick 2005\)\.
4. Even if there are differing views on what is and is not universal, see Cosmides and Tooby \(2013\), Cosmides, Barrett and Tooby \(2010\) and Pinker \(2010\)\. For an evolutionary ac\- count of the origins of hyperbolic discounting \(not limited to humans\), see Dasgupta and Maskin \(2005\)\. Often psychological evolu\- tionary arguments are based on time\-shifted rationality theories, which explain what is now described as a cognitive bias that deviates from rational choice as resulting from the persistence of cognition traits that evolved to adapt to environments in the evolutionary past\. For instance, Jaeger and others \(2020\) present evidence that links the magnitude of the endowment effect to evolutionary sa\- lience of different items\.
5. Henrich 2020\. The type of norm in question, whether it is injunctive \(prescribing behaviour\) or descriptive \(where people follow how others behaviour\), also matters on the type of emotion that has greater salience \(Elster 2015\)\.

\(2015\)\. That a person’s sense of self has behavioural implications is recognized in economic models of identity such as those by Akerlof and Kranton \(2000\), but those models do not specify where identity comes from, as recognized and explored in Huettel and Kranton \(2012\) and Kranton and others \(2020\)\. This perspective from sociology offers an answer to the question of where a sense of self comes about and how\.

2. See Lamont and others \(2017\) for an explo\- ration of the implications of this perspective on these studies\. Indeed, Lambe and others \(2020\) show that development interventions that build their understanding of behaviour change as contextual, taking place in relation to complex socioecological systems that also evolve over time, are more successful in cre\- ating robust and long\-lasting change\.

1. The sliver of humanity has been associ\- ated with the acronym WEIRD—Western, educated, individualistic, rich and democratic, referring to the overwhelming overrepresen\- tation of people with these characteristics in experimental findings in behavioural eco\- nomics\. Sometimes observed behaviour by WEIRD people deviates from the rational choice model—thus, described as some of the biases discussed above—in other cases behaviour consistent with rational choice is observed in non\-WEIRD populations \(Api\- cella, Norenzayan and Henrich 2020; Henrich 2020; Henrich, Heine and Norenzayan 2010a, 2010b; Muthukrishna and others 2020\)\.

Culture develops and is transmitted through social learning and affects not only how people solve specific problems but also how they conceptualize the world and think of their selves\. Culture shapes “core aspects of our attention, perception, thought, memory, reasoning, motivations, mentalizing abilities,
4. Morris, Chiu and Liu 2015; Vignoles and oth\- ers 2016\. The huge variation in beliefs and values occurs even within a shared cultural setting\. In fact, a set of cultural attributes and the psychological traits associated with it do not have a one\-to\-one counterpart at the indi\- vidual level \(Na and others 2010\)\. That is, just because one society can be associated with a cultural and psychological package charac\- terized by, say, more individualistic traits and another society can be characterized by more interdependent psychological traits does not mean that everyone in the first society is indi\- vidualistic and everyone in the second is not\. For instance, Markus \(2016\) and Markus and Kitayama \(1991\) have shown that the United States is a more individualistic culture valu\- ing independence than Japan but that within the United States\. However, Grusky, Hall and Markus \(2019\) found that some disadvan\- taged groups in the United States behave in a way and have an understanding of the self that values interdependence more than independence\. Lamont \(2000\) shows how different racial and socioeconomic groups in different countries construct different frames of how they live dignified lives, in cultural con\- texts that are dominated by individualistic and materialistic pursuits are culturally dominant signifiers of value\.

Similarly, recognizing that evolutionary processes may play a role in the changes of behaviour and institutions is important to understand cultural variation and change but does not mean that purposeful reasoning is abandoned as we wait for selection to do its work\. We may not have enough time to wait

1. To use the expression of Sen \(2009b\) when discussing how beliefs created under spe\- cific “positional features” form and are hard to change\. The example given by Sen is that of someone in a position who does not have knowledge of distance\-dependent projec\- tions and no other information about the sun and the moon as seen from Earth and con\- cludes that they are of the same size \(as they appear to be when observed from Earth\)\.

for transformative change\. Biodiversity not only mitigates, buffers and provides adaptive capacities to respond to the turbulence and uncertainty of the Anthropocene; it also rep\- resents an undervalued and underexplored source of options, innovation, capacities and opportunities for human development in an uncertain future\. Moreover, transformative change will ultimately depend on collective capacities to see and analyse the whole system, its social and ecological components, their dynamics and especially capacities to

1. We are grateful to Belinda Reyers for sug\- gesting that it is useful to understand what shapes people’s behaviour and the multiple processes through with behavioural change and institutional reform interact and appreci\- ate the inherent uncertainty associated with it\. But that is no reason to be resigned but rather to think ahead, even acknowledging that uncertainty will not be resolved\. As argued in chapter 1, what is required to ease planetary pressures and to navigate uncertain futures are transformative changes: we must go be\- yond adapting to existing conditions, towards strengthening capacities for transformations\. Specific capacities, such as learning and reflexivity, engaging with complex dynamics and diversity, navigating across scales and responding to emergent processes, have been found to be crucial \(Moore and others 2018\)\. Existing development practice has highlighted capacities such as coordinated decisionmaking, collective action and the capacities to innovate and experiment and is exploring the potential of transformative capacities such as shift in attitudes towards innovation and changes in cultural gender norms, agency and leadership \(Reyers and others 2022\)\. From a planetary perspective the global biosphere and the diversity of life on Earth form a critical aspect of capacities

3. Indeed, the Positive Peace Index developed by the Institute for Economics and Peace documents a decline in cooperative social attitudes\. This decline is linked to people’s di\- minished tolerance for differing views, declin\- ing trust in governments and reduced faith in democratic institutions \(Pinto and others 2022\)\.

Mature technology has reached sizeable deploy\- ment, and only incremental innovations are expected\. Early adoption technology means that some designs have reached markets and policy support is required for scale\-up\. But there are competing designs being validated at the demonstration and prototype phases\. Offshore power, wind power, electric batter\- ies and heat pumps are examples\. Examples of demonstration designs are carbon capture in cement kilns, electrolytic hydrogen\-based ammonia and methanol, and large long\- distance battery\-electric ships\. Prototype designs are at prototype stage of a certain scale\. Ammonia\-powered vessels, electrolytic hydrogen\-based steel production and direct air capture are examples of large prototypes\. Battery\-electric aircraft and direct electrifica\- tion of primary steelmaking are examples of small prototypes\. Technologies at the concept stage have just been formulated but need to be validated\. Lithium\-air batteries and electrifying a steam cracker for olefins production are examples\.

9. Nunn \(2021\) defined a function where cul\- tural transmission of knowledge depends on inclusion, creativity and solidarity to produce adaptative \(Payne and Wagner 2019; Pigli\- ucci 2008\) responses to new scenarios and circumstances \(Schimmelpfennig and others 2022\)\.
10. Community resilience plays a major role in coping with shocks\. In this context com\- munity resilience can be understood as the existence, development and engagement of community resources by community mem\- bers to thrive in an environment characterized by change, uncertainty, unpredictability and surprise\.
11. Results from a cross\-sectional and longitu\- dinal research case study reveal that com\- munity organizing elevates psychological empowerment and civic engagement over time \(Speer, Christens and Peterson 2021\)\.

20. Such arrangements depend in practice on the efficacy of processes for making and implementing major decisions throughout society—in a word, governance \(Florini, La\- Forge and Sharma 2022\)\. Governance is the process through which state and nonstate actors interact to design and implement poli\- cies within a given set of formal and informal rules that shape and are shaped by power \(World Bank 2017b\)\. There are many impedi\- ments to governance, from the distortion of information by powerful economic interests that diluted support to policies ranging from tobacco consumption control to climate change mitigation \(as reviewed in chapter 3\) to corruption\. Empirical evidence shows that corruption and poor governance correlate

<a id="_bookmark136"></a>with lower economic growth, investment and tax revenue \(Cerra and others 2021\)\. And governments that are captured by vested in\- terests are liable to hinder societally needed changes rather than bring them about \(Stein\- berger 2018\)\.

trust and embrace a comprehensive vision of human rights also include updated gover\- nance arrangements to deliver better public goods, health coverage, education, skills, decent work and housing, as well as universal access to the internet by 2030 as a basic hu\- man right\.

#### Readers guide

The statistical tables in this annex provide an over\- view of key aspects of human development\. The seven tables contain the family of composite hu\- man development indices and their components es\- timated by the Human Development Report Office \(HDRO\)\. The sixth table, on multidimensional pover\- ty, is produced in partnership with the Oxford Poverty and Human Development Initiative\.

Tables 1–7 are included in the 2021/2022 Human Development Report\. The five human development dashboards previously included as part of the Report are now published online\. The full set of seven sta\- tistical tables and five dashboards is available for download at [https://hdr\.undp\.org/human\-develop\-](https://hdr.undp.org/human-development-report-2021-22) [ment\-report\-2021–22](https://hdr.undp.org/human-development-report-2021-22)\. Unless otherwise noted, tables use data available to the HDRO as of 30 April 2022\. All indices and indicators, along with technical notes on the calculation of composite indices and additional source information, are available at [https://hdr\.undp\.](https://hdr.undp.org/data-center) [org/data\-center](https://hdr.undp.org/data-center)\.

Countries and territories are ranked by 2021 Human Development Index \(HDI\) value\. Robustness and reliability analysis has shown that for most coun\- tries differences in HDI are not statistically significant at the fourth decimal place\. For this reason countries with the same HDI value at three decimal places are listed with tied ranks\.

Sources and definitions

Unless otherwise noted, the HDRO uses data from in\- ternational data agencies with the mandate, resourc\- es and expertise to collect national data on specific indicators\.

Definitions of indicators and sources for original data components are given at the end of each table, with full source details in *Statistical references\.*

Methodology updates

The 2021/2022 Report retains all the composite indi\- ces from the family of human development indices—

the HDI, the Inequality\-adjusted Human Develop\- ment Index \(IHDI\), the Gender Development Index \(GDI\), the Gender Inequality Index \(GII\), the Multi\- dimensional Poverty Index \(MPI\) and the Planetary pressures\-adjusted Human Development Index \(PH\- DI\)\. The methodology used to compute the indices is the same as the one used in the 2020 Human De\- velopment Report\. For details, see *Technical notes 1–6 *at [http://hdr\.undp\.org/sites/default/files/hdr2022\_](http://hdr.undp.org/sites/default/files/hdr2022_technical_notes.pdf) [technical\_notes\.pdf](http://hdr.undp.org/sites/default/files/hdr2022_technical_notes.pdf)\.

Comparisons over time and across editions

Because national and international agencies continu\- ally improve their data series, the data—including the HDI values and ranks—presented in this report are not comparable to those published in earlier editions\. For HDI comparability across years and countries, see table 2, which presents trends using consistent da\- ta, or [https://hdr\.undp\.org/data\-center](https://hdr.undp.org/data-center), which pres\- ents interpolated consistent data\.

Discrepancies between national and international estimates

National and international data can differ because international agencies harmonize national data us\- ing a consistent methodology and occasionally pro\- duce estimates of missing data to allow comparability across countries\. In other cases international agen\- cies might not have access to the most recent national data\. When HDRO becomes aware of discrepancies, it brings them to the attention of national and inter\- national data authorities\.

Country groupings and aggregates

The tables present weighted aggregates for sev\- eral country groupings\. In general, an aggregate is shown only when data are available for at least half the countries and represent at least two\-thirds of

the population in that grouping\. Aggregates for each grouping cover only the countries for which data are available\.

__Human development classification__

HDI classifications are based on HDI fixed cutoff points, which are derived from the quartiles of dis\- tributions of the component indicators\. The cutoff points are HDI of less than 0\.550 for low human de\- velopment, 0\.550–0\.699 for medium human develop\- ment, 0\.700–0\.799 for high human development and 0\.800 or greater for very high human development\.

__Regional groupings__

Regional groupings are based on United Nations De\- velopment Programme regional classifications\. Least Developed Countries and Small Island Developing States are defined according to UN classifications \(see [https://www\.un\.org/ohrlls/](https://www.un.org/ohrlls/)\)\.

__Developing countries__

The aggregates for developing countries are based on information from all developing countries that are in\- cluded in a regional grouping\.

__Organisation for Economic Co‑operation and Development__

Of the 38 Organisation for Economic Co\-operation and Development members, 33 are considered de\- veloped countries and 5 \(Costa Rica, Chile, Colom\- bia, Mexico and Türkiye\) are considered developing countries\. Aggregates refer to all countries from the group for which data are available\.

Country notes

Data for China do not include Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of China, Macao Special Ad\- ministrative Region of China or Taiwan Province of China\.

As of 2 May 2016, Czechia is the short name to be used for the Czech Republic\.

As of 1 June 2018, the Kingdom of Eswatini is the name of the country formerly known as Swaziland\.

As of 14 February 2019, the Republic of North Macedonia \(short form: North Macedonia\) is the name of the country formerly known as the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia\.

As of 1 June 2022, Türkiye is the name of the coun\- try formerly known as Turkey\.

Symbols

A dash between two years, as in 2010–2021, indicates that the data are from the most recent year available during the period specified\. Growth rates are usually average annual rates of growth between the first and last years of the period shown\.

The following symbols are used in the tables:

\.\.	Not available

0 or 0\.0	Nil or negligible

—	Not applicable

Statistical acknowledgements

The Report’s composite indices and other statisti\- cal resources draw on a wide variety of the most respected international data providers in their spe\- cialized fields\. HDRO is particularly grateful to Eu\- rostat; the Global Carbon Project; ICF Macro; the International Labour Organization; the Internation\- al Monetary Fund; the Inter\-Parliamentary Union; the Luxembourg Income Study; the United Nations Maternal Mortality Estimation Inter\-Agency Group; the Organisation for Economic Co\-operation and

Development; the Socio\-Economic Database for Lat\- in America and the Caribbean; the United Nations Children’s Fund; the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs; the United Nations Edu\- cational, Scientific and Cultural Organization Insti\- tute for Statistics; the United Nations Environment Programme; the United Nations Statistics Division; the World Bank; and the World Inequality Database\. The international education database maintained by Robert Barro \(Harvard University\) and Jong\-Wha Lee \(Korea University\) was another invaluable source for the calculation of the Report’s indices\.

Statistical tables

The seven tables relate to the six composite human development indices and their components\. Since the 2010 Human Development Report, four compos\- ite human development indices—the HDI, the IHDI, the GII and the MPI for developing countries—have been calculated\. The 2014 Report introduced the GDI, which compares the HDI calculated separately for women and men\. The 2020 Report introduced the PHDI, which adjusts the HDI for excessive human pressure on the planet\.

For indicators that are global Sustainable Development Goals indicators or can be used in monitoring progress towards specific goals, the table headers include the relevant goals and targets\.

__Table 1, Human Development Index and its components, __ranks countries by 2021 HDI value and details the values of the three HDI components: lon\- gevity, education \(with two indicators\) and income per capita\. The table also presents the difference in rankings by HDI value and gross national income per capita, as well as the rank on the 2020 HDI, calcu\- lated using the most recently revised historical data available in 2022\.

__Table 2, Human Development Index trends, __1990–2021, provides a time series of HDI values al\- lowing 2021 HDI values to be compared with those

for previous years\. The table uses the most recently revised historical data available in 2022 and the same methodology applied to compute 2021 HDI values\. The table also includes the change in HDI rank over the last six years and the average annual HDI growth rate across four time intervals: 1990–2000, 2000– 2010, 2010–2021 and 1990–2021\.

__Table 3, Inequality\-adjusted Human Development Index, __contains two related meas\- ures of inequality—the IHDI and the overall loss in HDI due to inequality\. The IHDI looks beyond the average achievements of a country in longevity, edu\- cation and income to show how these achievements are distributed among its residents\. The IHDI value can be interpreted as the level of human develop\- ment when inequality is accounted for\. The relative difference between IHDI and HDI values is the loss due to inequality in distribution of the HDI within the country\. The table presents the coefficient of hu\- man inequality, which is the unweighted average of inequalities in the three dimensions\. In addition, the table shows each country’s difference in rank on the HDI and the IHDI\. A negative value means that tak\- ing inequality into account lowers a country’s rank on the HDI\. The table also presents the income shares of the poorest 40 percent, the richest 10 percent and the richest 1 percent of the population, as well as the Gini coefficient\.

__Table 4, Gender Development Index, __meas\- ures disparities on the HDI by gender\. The table con\- tains HDI values estimated separately for women and men, the ratio of which is the GDI value\. The closer the ratio is to 1, the smaller the gap between women and men\. Values for the three HDI components— longevity, education \(with two indicators\) and in\- come per capita—are also presented by gender\. The table includes five country groupings by absolute de\- viation from gender parity in HDI values\.

__Table 5, Gender Inequality Index, __presents a composite measure of gender inequality using three dimensions: reproductive health, empowerment and

the labour market\. The reproductive health indica\- tors are maternal mortality ratio and adolescent birth rate\. The empowerment indicators are the percent\- age of parliamentary seats held by women and the percentage of population with at least some second\- ary education by gender\. The labour market indicator is participation in the labour force by gender\. A low GII value indicates low inequality between women and men, and vice\-versa\.

__Table 6, Multidimensional Poverty Index, __cap\- tures the multiple deprivations that people in devel\- oping countries face in their health, education and standard of living\. The MPI shows both the incidence of nonincome multidimensional poverty \(a head\- count of those in multidimensional poverty\) and its intensity \(the average deprivation score experienced by multidimensionally poor people\)\. Based on dep\- rivation score thresholds, people are classified as multidimensionally poor, in severe multidimensional poverty or vulnerable to multidimensional poverty\. The table includes the contribution of deprivation in

each dimension to overall multidimensional pov\- erty\. It also presents measures of income poverty— population living below the national poverty line and population living on less than $1\.90 in purchasing power parity terms per day\.

__Table 7, Planetary pressures\-adjusted Human Development Index, __adjusts the HDI for plane\- tary pressures in the Anthropocene to reflect a con\- cern for intergenerational inequality, similar to the Inequality\-adjusted HDI adjustment, which is moti\- vated by a concern for intragenerational inequality\. The PHDI value can be interpreted as the level of hu\- man development adjusted by carbon dioxide emis\- sions per person \(production\-based\) and material footprint per person to account for excessive human pressure on the planet\. The table presents the rela\- tive difference between PHDI and HDI values as well as each country’s difference in rank on the HDI and the PHDI\. A negative value means that taking plan\- etary pressures into account lowers a country’s rank on the HDI\.

__Definitions__

__Human Development Index \(HDI\): __A composite index measur\- ing average achievement in three basic dimensions of human development—a long and healthy life, knowledge and a decent standard of living\. See *Technical note 1 *at [http://hdr\.undp\.org/](http://hdr.undp.org/sites/default/files/hdr2022_technical_notes.pdf) [sites/default/files/hdr2022\_technical\_notes\.pdf](http://hdr.undp.org/sites/default/files/hdr2022_technical_notes.pdf) for details on how the HDI is calculated\.

__Life expectancy at birth: __Number of years a newborn infant could expect to live if prevailing patterns of age\-specific mor\- tality rates at the time of birth stay the same throughout the infant’s life\.

__Expected years of schooling: __Number of years of schooling that a child of school entrance age can expect to receive if pre\- vailing patterns of age\-specific enrolment rates persist through\- out the child’s life\.

__Mean years of schooling: __Average number of years of educa\- tion received by people ages 25 and older, converted from ed\- ucation attainment levels using official durations of each level\.

__Gross national income \(GNI\) per capita: __Aggregate income of an economy generated by its production and its ownership of factors of production, less the incomes paid for the use of fac\- tors of production owned by the rest of the world, converted to international dollars using PPP rates, divided by midyear population\.

__GNI per capita rank minus HDI rank: __Difference in ranking by GNI per capita and by HDI value\. A negative value means that the country is better ranked by GNI than by HDI value\.

__HDI rank for 2020: __Ranking by HDI value for 2020, calculated using the same most recently revised data available in 2022 that were used to calculate HDI values for 2020\.

__Main data sources__

__Columns 1 and 7: __HDRO calculations based on data from Barro and Lee \(2018\), IMF \(2022\), UNDESA \(2022a\), UNESCO

Institute for Statistics \(2022\), United Nations Statistics Division \(2022\) and World Bank \(2022\)\.

__Notes__

For HDI values that are comparable across years and countries, use this table or the interpolated data at [https://hdr\.undp\.org/](https://hdr.undp.org/data-center) [data\-center](https://hdr.undp.org/data-center), which present trends using consistent data\.

1. A positive value indicates an improvement in rank\.
2. Value reported with relaxed aggregation rules\. For de\- tails on aggregation rules, see *Reader’s guide\.*

__Definitions__

__Human Development Index \(HDI\): __A composite index measur\- ing average achievement in three basic dimensions of human development—a long and healthy life, knowledge and a decent standard of living\. See *Technical note 1 *at [http://hdr\.undp\.org/](http://hdr.undp.org/sites/default/files/hdr2022_technical_notes.pdf) [sites/default/files/hdr2022\_technical\_notes\.pdf](http://hdr.undp.org/sites/default/files/hdr2022_technical_notes.pdf) for details on how the HDI is calculated\.

__Average annual HDI growth: __A smoothed annualized growth of the HDI in a given period, calculated as the annual com\- pound growth rate\.

__Main data sources__

__Columns 1–8: __HDRO calculations based on data from Barro and Lee \(2018\), IMF \(2022\), UNDESA \(2022a\), UNESCO In\-

stitute for Statistics \(2022\), United Nations Statistics Division \(2022\) and World Bank \(2022\)\.

__Column 9: __Calculated based on data in columns 4 and 8\.

__Columns 10–13: __Calculated based on data in columns 1, 2, 3

and 8\.

__Definitions__

__Human Development Index \(HDI\): __A composite index measur\- ing average achievement in three basic dimensions of human development—a long and healthy life, knowledge and a decent standard of living\. See *Technical note 1 *at [http://hdr\.undp\.org/](http://hdr.undp.org/sites/default/files/hdr2022_technical_notes.pdf) [sites/default/files/hdr2022\_technical\_notes\.pdf](http://hdr.undp.org/sites/default/files/hdr2022_technical_notes.pdf) for details on how the HDI is calculated\.

__Inequality‑adjusted HDI \(IHDI\): __HDI value adjusted for in\- equalities in the three basic dimensions of human develop\- ment\. See *Technical note 2 *at [http://hdr\.undp\.org/sites/default/](http://hdr.undp.org/sites/default/files/hdr2022_technical_notes.pdf) [files/hdr2022\_technical\_notes\.pdf](http://hdr.undp.org/sites/default/files/hdr2022_technical_notes.pdf) for details on how the IHDI is calculated\.

__Overall loss: __Percentage difference between the IHDI value and the HDI value\.

__Difference from HDI rank: __Difference in ranks on the IHDI and the HDI\.

__Coefficient of human inequality: __Average inequality in the three basic dimensions of human development\.

__Inequality in life expectancy: __Inequality in distribution of ex\- pected length of life based on data from life tables estimated using the Atkinson inequality index\.

__Inequality‑adjusted life expectancy index: __HDI life expectancy index value adjusted for inequality in distribution of expected length of life based on data from life tables listed in Main data sources\.

__Inequality in education: __Inequality in distribution of years of schooling based on data from household surveys estimated us\- ing the Atkinson inequality index\.

__Inequality‑adjusted education index: __HDI education index value adjusted for inequality in distribution of years of school\- ing based on data from household surveys listed in Main data sources\.

__Inequality in income: __Inequality in income distribution based on data from household surveys estimated using the Atkinson inequality index\.

__Inequality‑adjusted income index: __HDI income index value ad\- justed for inequality in income distribution based on data from household surveys listed in *Main data sources\.*

__Income shares: __Percentage share of income \(or consumption\) that accrues to the indicated population subgroups\.

__Income share held by richest 1%: __Share of pretax national in\- come held by the richest 1 percent of the population\. Pretax national income is the sum of all pretax personal income flows accruing to the owners of the production factors, labour and capital before the tax/transfer system is taken into account and after the pension system is taken into account\.

__Gini coefficient: __Measure of the deviation of the distribution of income among individuals or households in a country from a perfectly equal distribution\. A value of 0 represents absolute equality, a value of 100 absolute inequality\.

__Main data sources__

__Column 1: __HDRO calculations based on data from Barro and Lee \(2018\), IMF \(2022\), UNDESA \(2022a\), UNESCO Institute for

Statistics \(2022\), United Nations Statistics Division \(2022\) and World Bank \(2022\)\.

__Column 2: __Calculated as the geometric mean of the values in the inequality\-adjusted life expectancy index, inequality\- adjusted education index and inequality\-adjusted income index using the methodology in *Technical note 2 *\(available at [http://](http://hdr.undp.org/sites/default/files/hdr2022_technical_notes.pdf) [hdr\.undp\.org/sites/default/files/hdr2022\_technical\_notes\.pdf](http://hdr.undp.org/sites/default/files/hdr2022_technical_notes.pdf)\)\.

__Column 3: __Calculated based on data in columns 1 and 2\.

__Column 4: __Calculated based on IHDI values and recalculated HDI ranks for countries for which an IHDI value is calculated\.

__Column 5: __Calculated as the arithmetic mean of the values in inequality in life expectancy, inequality in education and in\- equality in income using the methodology in *Technical note 2 *\(available at [http://hdr\.undp\.org/sites/default/files/hdr2022\_](http://hdr.undp.org/sites/default/files/hdr2022_technical_notes.pdf) [technical\_notes\.pdf](http://hdr.undp.org/sites/default/files/hdr2022_technical_notes.pdf)\)\.

__Column 6: __Calculated based on complete life tables from UNDESA \(2022a\)\.

__Column 7: __Calculated based on inequality in life expectancy and the HDI life expectancy index\.

__Columns 8 and 10: __Calculated based on data from the Center for Distributive, Labor and Social Studies and the World Bank’s Socio\-Economic Database for Latin America and the Carib\- bean; Eurostat’s European Union Statistics on Income and Liv\- ing Conditions; ICF Macro Demographic and Health Surveys; the Luxembourg Income Study database; United Nations Chil\- dren’s Fund Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys; the United Na\- tions Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization Institute for Statistics; the World Bank’s International Income Distribution Database; and the World Income Inequality Database using the methodology in *Technical note 2 *\(available at [http://hdr\.undp\.](http://hdr.undp.org/sites/default/files/hdr2022_technical_notes.pdf) [org/sites/default/files/hdr2022\_technical\_notes\.pdf](http://hdr.undp.org/sites/default/files/hdr2022_technical_notes.pdf)\)\.

__Column 9: __Calculated based on inequality in education and the HDI education index\.

__Column 11: __Calculated based on inequality in income and the HDI income index\.

__Columns 12, 13 and 15: __World Bank \(2022\)\.

2. Countries are divided into five groups by absolute devia\- tion from gender parity in HDI values\.
3. Data refer to 2021 or the most recent year available\.
4. In calculating the male HDI value, estimated gross na\- tional income per capita is capped at $75,000\.
5. In calculating the female HDI value, expected years of schooling is capped at 18 years\.
6. In calculating the male HDI value, expected years of schooling is capped at 18 years\.

__Definitions__

__Gender Development Index: __Ratio of female to male HDI val\- ues\. See *Technical note 3 *at [http://hdr\.undp\.org/sites/default/](http://hdr.undp.org/sites/default/files/hdr2022_technical_notes.pdf) [files/hdr2022\_technical\_notes\.pdf](http://hdr.undp.org/sites/default/files/hdr2022_technical_notes.pdf) for details on how the Gen\- der Development Index is calculated\.

__Gender Development Index groups: __Countries are divided into five groups by absolute deviation from gender parity in HDI values\. Group 1 comprises countries with high equality in HDI achievements between women and men \(absolute deviation of less than 2\.5 percent\), group 2 comprises countries with medi\- um to high equality in HDI achievements between women and men \(absolute deviation of 2\.5–5 percent\), group 3 comprises countries with medium equality in HDI achievements between women and men \(absolute deviation of 5–7\.5 percent\), group 4 comprises countries with medium to low equality in HDI achievements between women and men \(absolute deviation of 7\.5–10 percent\) and group 5 comprises countries with low equality in HDI achievements between women and men \(ab\- solute deviation from gender parity of more than 10 percent\)\.

__Human Development Index \(HDI\): __A composite index measur\- ing average achievement in three basic dimensions of human development—a long and healthy life, knowledge and a decent standard of living\. See *Technical note 1 *at [http://hdr\.undp\.org/](http://hdr.undp.org/sites/default/files/hdr2022_technical_notes.pdf) [sites/default/files/hdr2022\_technical\_notes\.pdf](http://hdr.undp.org/sites/default/files/hdr2022_technical_notes.pdf) for details on how the HDI is calculated\.

__Life expectancy at birth: __Number of years a newborn infant could expect to live if prevailing patterns of age\-specific mor\- tality rates at the time of birth stay the same throughout the infant’s life\.

__Expected years of schooling: __Number of years of schooling that a child of school entrance age can expect to receive if pre\- vailing patterns of age\-specific enrolment rates persist through\- out the child’s life\.

__Mean years of schooling: __Average number of years of educa\- tion received by people ages 25 and older, converted from educational attainment levels using official durations of each level\.

__Estimated gross national income per capita: __Derived from the ratio of female to male wages, female and male shares of eco\- nomically active population and gross national income \(in 2017 purchasing power parity terms\)\. See *Technical note 3 *at [http://](http://hdr.undp.org/sites/default/files/hdr2022_technical_notes.pdf) [hdr\.undp\.org/sites/default/files/hdr2022\_technical\_notes\.pdf](http://hdr.undp.org/sites/default/files/hdr2022_technical_notes.pdf)  for details\.

__Definitions__

__Gender Inequality Index: __A composite measure reflecting inequality in achievement between women and men in three dimensions: reproductive health, empowerment and the la\- bour market\. See *Technical note 4 *at [http://hdr\.undp\.org/sites/](http://hdr.undp.org/sites/default/files/hdr2022_technical_notes.pdf) [default/files/hdr2022\_technical\_notes\.pdf](http://hdr.undp.org/sites/default/files/hdr2022_technical_notes.pdf) for details on how the Gender Inequality Index is calculated\.

__Maternal mortality ratio: __Number of deaths due to pregnancy\- related causes per 100,000 live births\.

__Adolescent birth rate: __Number of births to women ages 15–19 per 1,000 women ages 15–19\.

__TABLE 6__

		

__Notes__

1. Cross\-country comparisons should take into account the year of survey and the indicator definitions and omissions\. When an indicator is missing, weights of available indicators are adjusted to total 100 percent\. See [Technical note at https://hdr\.undp\.org/system/files/](https://hdr.undp.org/system/files/documents//mpi2021technicalnotespdf.pdf) [documents//mpi2021technicalnotespdf\.pdf](https://hdr.undp.org/system/files/documents//mpi2021technicalnotespdf.pdf) for details\.
2. *D *indicates data from Demographic and Health Surveys,

*M *indicates data from Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys,

*N *indicates data from national surveys and *P *indicates data from Pan Arab Population and Family Health Sur\- veys \(see [https://hdr\.undp\.org/mpi\-2021\-faqs](https://hdr.undp.org/mpi-2021-faqs) for the list of national surveys\)\.

1. Data refer to the most recent year available during the period specified\.
2. Missing indicator on nutrition\.
3. Value is not reported because it is based on a small number of multidimensionally poor people\.
4. Revised estimate\.
5. Captures only deaths of children under age 5 who died in the last five years and deaths of children ages 12–18 years who died in the last two years\.
6. The methodology was adjusted to account for missing indi\- cator on nutrition and incomplete indicator on child mortal\- ity \(the survey did not collect the date of child deaths\)\.
7. Considers child deaths that occurred at any time be\- cause the survey did not collect the date of child deaths\.
8. Missing indicator on cooking fuel\.
9. Multidimensional Poverty Index estimates are based on the 2016 National Health and Nutrition Survey\. Estimates based on the 2015 Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey are

0\.010 for Multidimensional Poverty Index value, 2\.6 for multidimensional poverty headcount \(%\), 3,207,000 for multidimensional poverty headcount in year of survey, 3,317,000 for projected multidimensional poverty head\- count in 2019, 40\.2 for intensity of deprivation \(%\), 0\.4 for population in severe multidimensional poverty \(%\), 6\.1 for population vulnerable to multidimensional poverty \(%\),

39\.9 for contribution of deprivation in health \(%\), 23\.8 for contribution of deprivation in education \(%\) and 36\.3 for contribution of deprivation in standard of living \(%\)\.

1. Missing indicator on child mortality\.
2. Indicator on sanitation follows the national classification in which pit latrine with slab is considered unimproved\.
3. Following the national report, latrines are considered an improved source for the sanitation indicator\.

o  Because of the high proportion of children excluded from nutrition indicators due to measurements not be\- ing taken, estimates based on the 2019 Serbia Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey should be interpreted with caution\. The unweighted sample size used for the multi\- dimensional poverty calculation is 82\.8 percent\.

1. Missing indicator on school attendance\.
2. Based on the version of data accessed on 7 June 2016\.
3. Given the information available in the data, child mortality was constructed based on deaths that occurred between surveys—that is, between 2012 and 2014\. Child deaths reported by an adult man in the household were taken into account because the date of death was reported\.
4. Missing indicator on housing\.
5. Missing indicator on electricity\.

__Definitions__

__Multidimensional Poverty Index: __Proportion of the popula\- tion that is multidimensionally poor adjusted by the intensity of the deprivations\. See [Technical note at https://hdr\.undp\.org/](https://hdr.undp.org/system/files/documents//mpi2021technicalnotespdf.pdf) [system/files/documents//mpi2021technicalnotespdf\.pdf](https://hdr.undp.org/system/files/documents//mpi2021technicalnotespdf.pdf) for de\- tails on how the Multidimensional Poverty Index is calculated\.

__Multidimensional poverty headcount: __Population with a depri\- vation score of at least 33 percent\. It is expressed as a share of the population in the survey year, the number of multidimen\- sionally poor people in the survey year and the projected num\- ber of multidimensionally poor people in 2019\.

__Intensity of deprivation of multidimensional poverty: __Average deprivation score experienced by people in multidimensional poverty\.

__Inequality among the poor: __Variance of individual deprivation scores of poor people\. It is calculated by subtracting the depri\- vation score of each multidimensionally poor person from the intensity, squaring the differences and dividing the sum of the weighted squares by the number of multidimensionally poor people\.

__Population in severe multidimensional poverty: __Percentage of the population in severe multidimensional poverty—that is, those with a deprivation score of 50 percent or more\.

__Population vulnerable to multidimensional poverty: __Percent\- age of the population at risk of suffering multiple deprivations— that is, those with a deprivation score of 20–33 percent\.

__Contribution of deprivation in dimension to overall multi‑ dimensional poverty: __Percentage of the Multidimensional Pov\- erty Index attributed to deprivations in each dimension\.

__Population living below national poverty line: __Percentage of the population living below the national poverty line, which is the poverty line deemed appropriate for a country by its au\- thorities\. National estimates are based on population\-weighted subgroup estimates from household surveys\.

__Population living below PPP $1\.90 a day: __Percentage of the population living below the international poverty line of $1\.90 \(in purchasing power parity \[PPP\] terms\) a day\.

__Main data sources__

__Column 1: __Refers to the year and the survey whose data were used to calculate the country’s Multidimensional Poverty Index value and its components\.

__Columns 2–12: __HDRO and OPHI calculations based on data on household deprivations in health, education and standard of liv\- ing from various household surveys listed in column 1 using the methodology described in [Technical note \(available at https://](https://hdr.undp.org/system/files/documents//mpi2021technicalnotespdf.pdf) [hdr\.undp\.org/system/files/documents//mpi2021technical](https://hdr.undp.org/system/files/documents//mpi2021technicalnotespdf.pdf) [notespdf\.pdf](https://hdr.undp.org/system/files/documents//mpi2021technicalnotespdf.pdf)\)\. Columns 4 and 5 also use population data from UNDESA \(2019\)\.

__Columns 13 and 14: __World Bank \(2021\)\.

__Planetary pressures‑adjusted HDI \(PHDI\): __HDI value adjusted by the level of carbon dioxide emissions and material footprint per capita to account for excessive human pressure on the planet\. It should be seen as an incentive for transformation\. See *Technical note 6 *at [http://hdr\.undp\.org/sites/default/files/](http://hdr.undp.org/sites/default/files/hdr2022_technical_notes.pdf) [hdr2022\_technical\_notes\.pdf](http://hdr.undp.org/sites/default/files/hdr2022_technical_notes.pdf) for details on how the PHDI is calculated\.

__Difference from HDI value: __Percentage difference between the PHDI value and the HDI value\.

__Difference from HDI rank: __Difference in ranks on the PHDI and the HDI\.

__Adjustment factor for planetary pressures: __Arithmetic average of the carbon dioxide emissions index and the material footprint index\. A high value implies less pressure on the planet\.

__Carbon dioxide emissions per capita \(production\): __Carbon dioxide emissions produced as a consequence of human ac\- tivities \(use of coal, oil and gas for combustion and industrial processes, gas flaring and cement manufacture\), divided by midyear population\. Values are territorial emissions, meaning that emissions are attributed to the country in which they physi\- cally occur\.

__Carbon dioxide emissions \(production\) index: __Carbon diox\- ide emissions per capita \(production\-based\) expressed as an index with a minimum value of 0 and a maximum value of 68\.72 tonnes per capita\. A high value implies less pressure on the planet\.

__Material footprint per capita: __The attribution of global material extraction to domestic final demand of a country, divided by midyear population\. Total material footprint is the sum of mate\- rial footprint for biomass, fossil fuels, metal ores and nonmetal ores, calculated as the raw material equivalent of imports plus domestic extraction minus raw material equivalents of exports\. Material footprint per capita describes the average material use for final demand\.

__Material footprint index: __Material footprint per capita ex\- pressed as an index with a minimum value of 0 and a maximum value of 107\.42 tonnes per capita\. A high value implies less pressure on the planet\.

__We live in a world of worry\. __The ongoing Covid\-19 pan\- demic, having driven reversals in human development in almost every country, continues to spin off variants unpre\- dictably\. War in Ukraine and elsewhere has created more human suffering\. Record\-breaking temperatures, fires, storms and floods sound the alarm of planetary systems increasingly out of whack\. Together, they are fuelling a cost\-of\-living crisis felt around the world, painting a pic\- ture of uncertain times and unsettled lives\.

Uncertainty is not new, but its dimensions are taking om\- inous new forms today\. A new “uncertainty complex” is emerging, never before seen in human history\. Constitut\- ing it are three volatile and interacting strands: the desta\- bilizing planetary pressures and inequalities of the Anthro\- pocene, the pursuit of sweeping societal transformations to ease those pressures and the widespread and intensi\- fying polarization\.

This new uncertainty complex and each new crisis it spawns are impeding human development and unsettling lives the world over\. In the wake of the pandemic, and for the first time ever, the global Human Development Index \(HDI\) value declined—for two years straight\. Many coun\- tries experienced ongoing declines on the HDI in 2021\. Even before the pandemic, feelings of insecurity were on the rise nearly everywhere\. Many people feel alienated from their political systems, and in another reversal, dem\- ocratic backsliding has worsened\.

There is peril in new uncertainties, in the insecurity, polar\- ization and demagoguery that grip many countries\. But there is promise, too—an opportunity to reimagine our futures, to renew and adapt our institutions and to craft new stories about who we are and what we value\. This is the hopeful path forward, the path to follow if we wish to thrive in a world in flux\.
