It explains that when people are uncertain about how to value a risky asset or form probabilistic estimates, they tend to anchor on an intermediate decision and only partially adjust away from it. This leads to an overestimation of the probability of unlikely events and an overweighting of low probabilities. \n\nIn intertemporal decisions, where people trade off money or goods at different points in time, a similar compression effect is observed. People tend to treat different time delays similarly and value delayed payments towards an intermediate value. This compression effect cannot be explained by standard models such as discounted expected utility or present bias. \n\nThe document suggests that cognitive uncertainty, rather than nonstandard preferences, may be driving these patterns. When people are uncertain about the value of a delayed payment, they anchor on an intermediate cognitive default decision and adjust insufficiently from there.
